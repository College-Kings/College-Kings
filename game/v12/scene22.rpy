    scene v12rir5

    scene v12rir5
    with dissolve

    ri "I really did! I don't know if you could tell but, I've been on a bit of a roller coaster lately with Amber and really needed to just have some fun."

    with dissolve

    ri "Her and I are good now. Not as good as we were, but we're still cool... Aubrey spent a lot of time with me last night. We've actually been hanging a lot more lately."

    scene v12rir11c # FPP Same angle as v12rir11, Riley looking away, smiling with mouth closed

    scene v12rir11
    with dissolve

    u "Aubrey knows a lot about you, huh?"

    scene v12rir11b
    with dissolve

    ri "She knows a lot, but she doesn't know everything. Nobody really knows everything, haha."

    scene v12rir11c
    with dissolve

    u "Tell me something about you that nobody knows."

    scene v12rir11a
    with dissolve

    ri "If it's something nobody knows then, don't you think there's a reason why I haven't told anyone?"

    scene v12rir11
    with dissolve

    u "But I'm not just \"anyone\", I'm [name]. *Chuckles*"

    scene v12rir11a

    with dissolve

    scene v12rir11a
    with dissolve

    ri "Yep, I just looked like a little blueberry. The braces didn't help either. *Chuckles*"

    scene v12rir11c
    with dissolve

    u "This is a fascinating photo... *Chuckles* You've definitely changed a lot."

    with dissolve

    ri "Well, thank you. I keep the picture in my wallet as a reminder of where I used to be and how far I've come."

    scene v12rir11

    scene v12rir11c

    u "It'd bother you?"

    scene v12rir11d # FPP Same angle as v12rir11, Riley looking at MC, Riley looks upset or disgusted, mouth open
    with dissolve

    ri "Ugh, did you see what I looked like in that photo? Of course it'd bother me. That's why I keep it in my wallet, but even that's a risk 'cause I don't always keep my wallet on me."

    scene v12rir11e # FPP Same angle as v12rir11, Riley looking at MC, Riley looks worried, mouth closed
    with dissolve

    u "Well, you don't have to worry about me messing with it. So if no one else knows that there's something in there, I think you're in the clear."

    scene v12rir11a

    ri "I would honestly be devastated if you did expose my picture... I may even hate you after something like that. *Chuckles*"

    scene v12rir11a
