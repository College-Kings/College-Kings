    with dissolve

    u "Aubrey knows a lot about you, huh?"

    scene v12rir11b
    with dissolve

    ri "She knows a lot, but she doesn't know everything. Nobody really knows everything, haha."

    scene v12rir11c
    with dissolve

    u "Tell me something about you that nobody knows."

    scene v12rir11a
    with dissolve

    ri "If it's something nobody knows then, don't you think there's a reason why I haven't told anyone?"

    scene v12rir11a

    scene v12rir11d # FPP Same angle as v12rir11, Riley looking at MC, Riley looks upset or disgusted, mouth open
    with dissolve

    ri "Ugh, did you see what I looked like in that photo? Of course it'd bother me. That's why I keep it in my wallet, but even that's a risk 'cause I don't always keep my wallet on me."

    scene v12rir11e # FPP Same angle as v12rir11, Riley looking at MC, Riley looks worried, mouth closed
    with dissolve

    u "Well, you don't have to worry about me messing with it. So if no one else knows that there's something in there, I think you're in the clear."
