    scene v11sas6b
    with dissolve

    scene v11sas6f
    with dissolve

    u "I don't wanna read too much into it, but you gotta see the connections here."

    scene v11sas6e
    with dissolve

    sa "I mean yeah, but he still does way too much."

    scene v11sas6f
    with dissolve

    u "That's how we may take it, but he may not see it that way. Especially if he blames himself for everything that happened to you."

    u "So you slip when some shit happens?"

    scene v11sas6b
    with dissolve

    sa "I wouldn't call it a slip, I didn't make some vow to be sober. I enjoy a drink and getting high every once in a while. When I feel the need to relax a bit, I do."

    scene v11sas6c
    with dissolve

    u "Coming to a spa like this is just as good, I could fall asleep in here."

    scene v11sas6b

    scene v11sas6b
    with dissolve

    sa "Wasn't my first choice and I planned on transferring, but I made a few friends and it didn't matter because Cameron said if I transferred he would too."
