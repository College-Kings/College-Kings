    ri "I literally know nothing except for the things I've seen in movies. And in movies, there's no middle man. It's either the plane crashes or people are enjoying themselves in first class."
    ri "And although one of those would be nice, it won't be happening... So I really hope the plane doesn't crash."

    scene v11s3bris9
    with dissolve

    u "*Laughs* Yeah, talking to Amber about your fears probably wasn't a good idea. If I had never flown before and talked to Amber before my first time, I'd be nervous too. She has that kind of power."
