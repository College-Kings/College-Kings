# -Peace and Cheex can help with this scene: MC walks up to Lindsey and they have a convo by the car with a few images of the car. When MC is ready to take pictures we will go to a free roam shot of the car. Highlight the passenger side, driver side, hood, and trunk. MC chooses in any order where to take pics. Once they've taken the pic, revert back to the freeroam screen where their previous choice is now greyed out, and the other choices remain while ALSO having a "Finish" button in the bottom right. MC has to take one photo, but can choose whether to take all 4, or leave after each one. Revert back to the freeroam screen after each photo is taken, the player makes their choices, and when all 4 have been taken or if they click "finish", -if finish dialogue.

# -MC approaches Lindsey who is standing next to a dirty (needs to be seen that it hasn't been washed b/c dialogue) old Volkswagen. They both smile when they see each other-

# -Lindsey mentioned that she would get dressed up for the photos if MC chose the option to have her in the photos on the planning board. So either way I need her in something new, something cute, sexy, but not lingerie. Heels probably, makeup maybe, MAKE SURE SHE HAS POCKETS for a lollipop, etc-

    scene v14s47_1 # TPP. Show MC arriving at the parking lot, back to camera, Lindsey leaning on the car, make sure car is dirty and old looking, slightly worried, not looking at MC, Lindsey and the car are far from MC
