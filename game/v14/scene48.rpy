# -LIE: Modern, imported, classic sports car. One previous owner. All original and in excellent condition. Engine runs very smoothly. Low mileage. Incredible value. Buy now while you still can!-

# -BE HONEST: Classic car from the 1970s. A great restoration project. Ideal for collectors and enthusiasts. Runs OK but in desperate need of some TLC. Still, a great deal for the right person!-
