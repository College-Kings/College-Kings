    scene v13s1_1b

    u "Okay, but... Why his suitcase?"

    scene v13s1_1d
    with dissolve

    ri "Charli told me back in London that his grandmother gave it to him when he came out to her, so it's extremely special to him. That's what makes it the perfect target."

    u "This is a bit of a dark side for you, you know? I thought you were a nice girl... *Chuckles*"

    scene v13s1_1a
    with dissolve

    ri "Nope, never claimed to be! I just act accordingly. If people are nice to me I'll be an angel, but the minute they cross me, I cross them."

    u "Seems fair. *Chuckles*"

    scene v13s1_1a

    scene v13s1_1d
    with dissolve

    u "Bleach?"

    scene v13s1_1a
    with dissolve

    ri "Yep. There's been some in every hotel we've stayed at so far, under the sink in the bathrooms... You can ruin anything with a little bleach."

    scene v13s1_1b
    with dissolve

    u "Perfect, I'll keep that in mind. Do you know when we're leaving for Amsterdam? I thought we'd be going early this morning."
