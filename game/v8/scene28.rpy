# Drug Deal With Josh
# Location: Urban Alley
# Outfits: MC Outfit 2, Josh Outfit 1, Lars Outfit 1, Joe Outfit 1
# Time: Monday Evening bordering on Night
# Please save each scene as some scenes continue from previous scenes as I had to move things around. This is my bad - I have noted when you need to go back in render descriptions.
# It's probably best to look at the rpy file to get a better understand of the timeline of the renders.
