Sooo... long story short, I asked his daughter to prom and - after some very painful back and forth - she said yes. We danced all night and I tried to give him as much eye contact as I possibly could, it was so funny. To be honest, the girl really wasn't keen on it once she found out why I had asked her, but... totally worth it. *Laughs*"
