v10_linds_room_b3a2a744	li	When we used to travel people would think we were sisters. Sometimes when we went on vacations we'd act as if we were sisters and flirt with guys.	game/v10/scene11.rpy	142	li "[what]"
v10_linds_room_417aba48	li	We goofed off a lot, but it was always so much fun with her.	game/v10/scene11.rpy	144	li "[what]"

v10_wolves_redec_83b04292	guyd	Well, the reason I ran and chose not to fight isn't because I didn't want to, it's because I couldn't.	game/v10/scene13.rpy	114	guyd "[what]"

v10_apes_samantha_5abedfb3	sa	*Laughs* Yeah, it's very subtle. But yeah, he's always been a hothead so it makes sense to me for a guy like him to fight and be in a frat like this, but you're not like him and yet you're in this frat too.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	67	sa "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_ac2ba772	u	And your question is...	game/v10/scene14.rpy	72	u "[what]"

v10_apes_samantha_5f618586	u	But they never got into any trouble. I did anything remotely questionable, there I go, straight to detention.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	123	u "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_23f6db01	u	Well at some point I got really fed up and I wanted to piss him off you know, get him really good.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	125	u "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_583f4165	sa	Please tell me this is leading to something really juicy like a senior prank or sugar in a gas tank?	game/v10/scene14.rpy	130	sa "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_d7d75ef6	u	Not quite. He announced that he was gonna be one of the chaperones for our senior prom and I knew his daughter just happened to be going to our school and graduating with me.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	135	u "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_5a247805	u	Sooo... long story short, I asked his daughter to prom and - after some very painful back and forth - she said yes.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	137	u "[what]"

v10_apes_samantha_783c1171	u	*Chuckles* What's that supposed to mean?	game/v10/scene14.rpy	159	u "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_bb7e8d5f	sa	You know.. Just that you're not really the strong macho type.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	164	sa "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_8d4b7f35	u	I'll have you know that I can be quite a dangerous thumb-wrestler. Also, I still like doing dumb shit, I'm just trying to be smart about the dumb shit I do	game/v10/scene14.rpy	169	u "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_5cdd5204	sa	*Laughs* Was that your senior quote or something?	game/v10/scene14.rpy	174	sa "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_b43a6b84	u	No, but it definitely could've been. My senior quote was way better. It went something like *chuckles* "Cheaters never win, but I just did."	game/v10/scene14.rpy	179	u "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_4e2a4378	sa	*Laughs* So you were the "can I copy off of you" kinda guy?	game/v10/scene14.rpy	184	sa "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_d89ea267	u	Hey, who's smarter, the guy that studies all night so he can get the right answers or the guy that doesn't study and then gets the answers from the guy that studies the next morning.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	189	u "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_cabed922	sa	What's that saying? "Don't hate the player, hate the game."	game/v10/scene14.rpy	194	sa "[what]"
v10_apes_samantha_46698d44	u	Exactly.	game/v10/scene14.rpy	199	u "[what]"

v10s15_c1_11cfe09a	u	I was the star in a children's show as an infant, and I'm a pretty good harmonica player.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	160	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_89cc83a0	la	So you just jump to the hardest difficulty huh? *Laughs*	game/v10/scene15.rpy	168	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_13ef612a	u	I don't want to brag or anything, but I am sort of a professional at this game. The trick is to live a life that's utterly ridiculous.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	173	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_9b755f5b	la	Honestly, I have no idea, haha. But I really want the harmonica and children's show stuff to be true, so I'm gonna say you did not get chased by a pack of dogs. Am I right?	game/v10/scene15.rpy	181	la "[what]"

v10s15_c1_864c99cd	la	My dad always changed his answer when we played games. He'd put his fingers behind his back and tell me to guess how many fingers he was holding up.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	196	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_6ffb8151	la	No matter what I guessed I'd always be wrong because come to find out he would change it if I got it right.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	198	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_d805ddb1	u	*Smiles* That's actually hilarious. But I won't do you like that. You actually were right.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	203	u "[what]"

v10s15_c1_b23d8e06	la	I was gonna say it would've been impressive if you could stand the smell that long. In that case, we have to pause the game and talk about these truths.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	221	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_b488e4aa	u	Yeah to be fair, I kinda knew you were gonna follow up on them when I said them out loud. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene15.rpy	226	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_07959c46	la	Sooo, you were an infant TV sensation? And you've never told me about it?	game/v10/scene15.rpy	234	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_fd88e514	u	*Laughs* First of all, sensation may be pushing it a bit. Second of all, I don't really tell anyone about it.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	239	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_2c8c90bd	u	I mean it was all my grandmother's idea really.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	241	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_0f2c7050	u	She was obsessed at how cute I was so she found me an agent, my agent got me on the show, and after one short season the show got cancelled.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	243	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_bb9614d8	u	The rest is history.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	245	u "[what]"

v10s15_c1_3bcc7f84	la	*Laughs* Now you do!	game/v10/scene15.rpy	263	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_519daadf	u	It's because I gained a whole lot of baby weight and the producers said a "fat" baby wasn't good for the camera.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	268	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_ef26e8a3	la	Awww, why is that both funny and sad? Okay, now explain the second one.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	276	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_c83ae144	u	What was the second one again? Only thing I can think about right now are my fat baby rolls.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	281	u "[what]"

v10s15_c1_dc1889ba	u	Oh yeah, I played a lot growing up. I used to love those old western movies and all the cool cowboys played the harmonica so I picked it up.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	294	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_fe131699	u	After a few years of dabbling, I got really good.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	296	u "[what]"

v10s15_c1_93b150ea	la	I'm gonna need proof of a claim that bold.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	314	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_500e6417	u	I guess it wouldn't hurt to give a little performance sometime.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	330	u "[what]"

v10s15_c1_c810edf2	la	Can't wait. You don't hear of a lot of people playing the harmonica, almost as rare as hearing someone be able to play the harp.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	346	la "[what]"
v10s15_c1_0c368585	u	What can I say, I'm a unique guy.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	351	u "[what]"

v10s15_c1_92cb80b4	u	You know, playing the harmonica requires quite a lot of tongue coordination, usually girls like that.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	370	u "[what]"
v10s15_c1_ced11d9b	la	*Laughs* Ewww, [name] stop it!	game/v10/scene15.rpy	379	la "[what]"

v10s15_c2_da69e2a1	u	Honestly, I'm not sure if I made it up or learned about it from someone else. It's a pretty simple game.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	456	u "[what]"
v10s15_c2_7c33fcd8	u	I just name a topic, say my favorite thing in that topic and then you answer your favorite. Then the game continues, but switched.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	458	u "[what]"
v10s15_c2_263777eb	la	Uhm, I mean sure. Anything's better than doing nothing on this train.	game/v10/scene15.rpy	467	la "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_edd97c8e	u	Just make things go as planned then, sounds easy enough. Nothings ever gone wrong at a college student hosted event. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	36	u "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_08b3ac50	la	Hopefully.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	52	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_ad0b15df	la	It's also like... what if no one comes to my thing? And I put all this work in and just no one ever comes by.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	57	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_6aad51bc	u	*Laughs* So the whole event is buzzing and every stand has a long queue, but just absolutely no one comes to you? That would be pretty funny to be fair.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	62	u "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_d07e2048	u	What happened in middle school?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	82	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_cd608925	la	We had this school science fair, where everyone was supposed to show off the project they had been working on for the last few months-	game/v10/scene18.rpy	87	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_44550014	u	Let me guess, you didn't have a project.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	92	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_bbe009af	la	Oh no, I actually had an amazing project. I had worked on it non-stop for four months straight.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	97	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_e58ae4fa	la	It was a huge installation of the solar system that would look beautiful and glow in the dark. It had proper orbiting and everything.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	99	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_5b2fd806	la	Since it would work best in the dark, I asked if I could have a room at the school instead of showing it off at a stand in the gym like everyone else.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	101	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_886d3317	la	Well, once the science fair started, I waited 6 hours in that room. By myself. Not even the teacher that unlocked the room for me came by.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	103	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_c730f9ae	la	Apparently he had forgotten to put up the sign that'd tell people about my installation.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	105	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9cddb323	u	Holy shit, that's so sad. I wish I could've seen the project. It sounds really cool.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	110	u "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_b72af6ed	u	Sounds like you really didn't have a good time in middle school.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	130	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9368b33a	la	It was a private school, so... no.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	135	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_70836490	u	Damn, you went to a private school?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	140	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_34637223	la	Not just any private school... a very strict, religious one.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	145	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_213c4edb	u	Oh, I didn't even know you were super religious.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	150	u "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_57f3faab	u	So what's that like, growing up with very religious parents?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	160	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_d1a3c8c5	la	Uhm I don't know. I love my parents, but there were times when I really felt like I needed a break from them.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	165	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_8d5cf2ce	la	My sister never really got along with them. Her whole "fight the system" mindset. She was always her own person and to be honest, I've always respected that a lot about her.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	167	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_af9ac2ee	u	Do you feel like you're not your own person?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	172	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_d567b340	la	Well, I just like making people happy. Sometimes to make others happy I have to do what I don't want to do. Maybe I just want to do me for once, you know?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	177	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_c300adc2	u	Yeah, I get what you mean. I feel like we shouldn't ever sacrifice our own happiness just to make others happy. If we don't look out for ourselves then who will.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	186	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9fbfe485	la	Never too late to start living for Lauren. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	191	la "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_ef55f80c	u	I guess, but it's also nice to make other people happy. I don't know, your selflessness is one of the things I like most about you.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	202	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_e259bc54	la	Thanks, I guess. Yeah, you're probably right. I don't know. I think it's about finding a balance.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	207	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_41aee1b9	la	So uhm... rapid change of topics, do you want kids someday?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	212	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_ed206474	u	Wait, is this like a trick question where I gotta make sure that my answer doesn't hurt your feelings or something?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	218	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_eeb719d0	la	*Laughs* No, I'm just interested in my boyfriend's thoughts.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	223	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_d8d58629	u	Haha alright.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	228	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_341f3398	u	Someday I do, I consider myself somewhat of a family man. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	237	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_aedc0875	la	I do too, well, family woman. The chance to create a person and then just be able to give that person the most amazing life possible just sounds too good to pass up on.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	242	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_ec523e46	la	I think we'd make great parents, you know? And as long as you don't let your mother feed them, we may even have another childhood star in the family. *Laughs*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	248	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9a90e255	u	*Chuckles* Just not letting that one go, are you?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	253	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_afdeb934	la	Not a chance.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	258	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_341f3398_1	u	Someday I do, I consider myself somewhat of a family man. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	264	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_150ac2a4	la	Those poor kids, little do they know they're doomed to be fat babies.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	269	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9a90e255_1	u	*Chuckles* Just not letting that one go, are you?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	274	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_afdeb934_1	la	Not a chance.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	279	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_fdd1ca76	u	I don't think so, kinda sounds expensive. I'm just not really a big family man.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	285	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_eec36158	la	Really? I definitely want kids. The chance to create a person and then just be able to give that person the most amazing life possible just sounds too good to pass up on.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	290	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_2460e7aa	u	Yeah, I guess. I don't really know, it seems like a lot of responsibility.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	295	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_1db55f51	la	*Laughs* Having a kid? Yeah that's kind of the point.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	300	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_77b9bc23	u	You ever just have random questions pop up in your head, but then you're like... wait a minute, I don't even know what I'd do in that scenario?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	305	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_e66e68fc	la	What? *Chuckles* Give me an example.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	310	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_dc7fadd3	u	Okay, so right before I went to bed last night I thought about this. If you're a genie and someone says "I wish you wouldn't grant me this wish", what do you do?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	315	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_26f1f200	la	Uhm, not grant him the wish! *Laughs*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	320	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_55e92563	u	You're making it too easy! If you're not granting him the wish then you would be granting him the wish, but that would mean you wouldn't grant him the wish and that-	game/v10/scene18.rpy	325	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_0517d272	la	Okay, okay. I see what you're getting at. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	330	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_6ad30c91	la	Anyways it looks like we're pulling up on the station, I really appreciate that we talked the whole time! Made time pass by a lot faster.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	332	la "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_70836490_1	u	Damn, you went to a private school?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	495	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_34637223_1	la	Not just any private school... a very strict, religious one.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	500	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_213c4edb_1	u	Oh, I didn't even know you were super religious.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	505	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_a4af9b8f_1	la	I don't know what I am, but I know my parents are.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	510	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_57f3faab_1	u	So what's that like, growing up with very religious parents?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	515	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_d1a3c8c5_1	la	Uhm I don't know. I love my parents, but there were times when I really felt like I needed a break from them.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	520	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_8d5cf2ce_1	la	My sister never really got along with them. Her whole "fight the system" mindset. She was always her own person and to be honest, I've always respected that a lot about her.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	522	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_af9ac2ee_1	u	Do you feel like you're not your own person?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	527	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_d567b340_1	la	Well, I just like making people happy. Sometimes to make others happy I have to do what I don't want to do. Maybe I just want to do me for once, you know?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	532	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_c300adc2_1	u	Yeah, I get what you mean. I feel like we shouldn't ever sacrifice our own happiness just to make others happy. If we don't look out for ourselves then who will.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	541	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9fbfe485_1	la	Never too late to start living for Lauren. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	546	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_372d1d91_1	u	*Chuckles* Exactly.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	551	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_ef55f80c_1	u	I guess, but it's also nice to make other people happy. I don't know, your selflessness is one of the things I like most about you.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	557	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_e259bc54_1	la	Thanks, I guess. Yeah, you're probably right. I don't know. I think it's about finding a balance.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	562	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_41aee1b9_1	la	So uhm... rapid change of topics, do you want kids someday?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	567	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_ed206474_1	u	Wait, is this like a trick question where I gotta make sure that my answer doesn't hurt your feelings or something?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	573	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_eeb719d0_1	la	*Laughs* No, I'm just interested in my boyfriend's thoughts.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	578	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_d8d58629_1	u	Haha alright.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	583	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_341f3398_2	u	Someday I do, I consider myself somewhat of a family man. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	592	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_aedc0875_1	la	I do too, well, family woman. The chance to create a person and then just be able to give that person the most amazing life possible just sounds too good to pass up on.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	597	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_ec523e46_1	la	I think we'd make great parents, you know? And as long as you don't let your mother feed them, we may even have another childhood star in the family. *Laughs*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	603	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9a90e255_2	u	*Chuckles* Just not letting that one go, are you?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	608	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_afdeb934_2	la	Not a chance.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	613	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_341f3398_3	u	Someday I do, I consider myself somewhat of a family man. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	619	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_150ac2a4_1	la	Those poor kids, little do they know they're doomed to be fat babies.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	624	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_9a90e255_3	u	*Chuckles* Just not letting that one go, are you?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	629	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_afdeb934_3	la	Not a chance.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	634	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_fdd1ca76_1	u	I don't think so, kinda sounds expensive. I'm just not really a big family man.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	640	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_eec36158_1	la	Really? I definitely want kids. The chance to create a person and then just be able to give that person the most amazing life possible just sounds too good to pass up on.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	645	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_2460e7aa_1	u	Yeah, I guess. I don't really know, it seems like a lot of responsibility.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	650	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_1db55f51_1	la	*Laughs* Having a kid? Yeah that's kind of the point.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	655	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_77b9bc23_1	u	You ever just have random questions pop up in your head, but then you're like... wait a minute, I don't even know what I'd do in that scenario?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	660	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_e66e68fc_1	la	What? *Chuckles* Give me an example.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	665	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_dc7fadd3_1	u	Okay, so right before I went to bed last night I thought about this. If you're a genie and someone says "I wish you wouldn't grant me this wish", what do you do?	game/v10/scene18.rpy	670	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_26f1f200_1	la	Uhm, not grant him the wish! *Laughs*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	675	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_55e92563_1	u	You're making it too easy! If you're not granting him the wish then you would be granting him the wish, but that would mean you wouldn't grant him the wish and that-	game/v10/scene18.rpy	680	u "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_0517d272_1	la	Okay, okay. I see what you're getting at. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene18.rpy	685	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_6ad30c91_1	la	Anyways it looks like we're pulling up on the station, I really appreciate that we talked the whole time! Made time pass by a lot faster.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	687	la "[what]"
v10_call_with_lauren2_43f449a5_1	u	*Chuckles* Anytime.	game/v10/scene18.rpy	692	u "[what]"

v10_call_with_lauren2_a102f141_1	u	(Wow, that was quite a long call, but I feel like I really learned a lot about her... It's not that late, maybe I can go for a bit of a walk before going to bed.)	game/v10/scene18.rpy	712	u "[what]"

v10_cafe_w_jenny_04e7e585	u	It's a little more serious than we'd all like it to be.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	106	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_c5abb9e6	jen	That doesn't sound good.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	111	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_baf86865	u	As we both know, Penelope is a really nice and caring person, but sometimes she cares a little too much... Her kindness just gets in the way of her judgment.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	116	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_b0d8fbd6	jen	Who'd she go saving now?	game/v10/scene22.rpy	121	jen "[what]"

v10_cafe_w_jenny_7d03d712	u	Well, Penelope told me a while ago that a friend of hers had some trouble and she wanted to do whatever she could to help her out.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	136	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_1b44b3d8	u	Come to find out, that "whatever" was hacking into the school system and getting her friend accepted into San Vallejo College.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	138	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_1e6688ec	jen	She did what???	game/v10/scene22.rpy	143	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_4323fcba	u	When she told me I was pretty worried so I went to the dean to see what I could do. After our conversation things seemed better, but it's still pretty serious.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	148	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_57feefbe	jen	So that's how I... oh my god, I should've known. There was no way I was getting accepted, I had already given up.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	153	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_ff619f40	jen	But Penelope just kept telling me not to worry about it and everything would work out.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	154	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_2dc57061	jen	Wow, this is all my fault. She wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for me. *Sigh* So much for being a good friend...	game/v10/scene22.rpy	155	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_2b320b75	u	Penelope always puts others before herself, even if you knew and tried to stop her, she probably still would've done it.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	165	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_fa66cd59	u	All we can do now is focus on what's next. No matter how rough it gets I'm sure it'll all gonna work out.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	170	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_f73d6e97	u	Let's try to stay positive. Focusing on the bad stuff isn't going to help. Let's just take it one step at a time.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	173	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_b6f5743b	jen	You're right, I just wish she would've told me. Maybe I could've done something.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	178	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_cde20a5b	jen	Penelope must really trust you to confide in you, she tends to keep stuff like that to herself...	game/v10/scene22.rpy	179	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_ed40ca81	u	Yeah, guess I just have that "you can trust me" face.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	184	u "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_d70e6a1d	jen	I can see that.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	189	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_db9974ae	jen	Kinda off topic, but this is a really nice cafe. It has a really cute, rustic vibe.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	190	jen "[what]"
v10_cafe_w_jenny_26ed397e	u	Yeah, I've been here a few times now. It's kinda becoming a favorite spot of mine.	game/v10/scene22.rpy	195	u "[what]"

v10_late_alley_b1863612	u	Bro, have your "clients" stop by your house or get someone else to deliver for you and give them a little cut. Doing it here is dangerous.	game/v10/scene31.rpy	143	u "[what]"

v10s33_autumn1_df090562	aut	I take a more uhm... lead by example approach, instead of just passing out orders. Though some were more eager to help than others. *Chuckles*	game/v10/scene33.rpy	84	aut "[what]"

v10s33_autumn1_5525d078	aut	Hmm, I don't know. It sounds fun, but the Deers may feel neglected if I'm gone for too long.	game/v10/scene33.rpy	191	aut "[what]"
v10s33_autumn1_176f5948	u	*Chuckles* You say it like they're your kids. I'm sure they can take care of themselves while you're on vacation.	game/v10/scene33.rpy	196	u "[what]"

v11_start_71c7d1a1	de	So be it. Allow me to lay out the situation of this hearing.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	131	de "[what]"
v11_start_f28eba93	de	Miss Cross is being charged with interference in the application process in an effort to get her friend admitted into San Vallejo College.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	133	de "[what]"
v11_start_89e0dc01	de	This was done by hacking into admissions and making necessary adjustments without any permission or legal access. Is this accurate, Miss Cross?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	135	de "[what]"
v11_start_e9d350e8_1	pe	Yes ma'am.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	140	pe "[what]"
v11_start_ae1b436f	de	Good, so with all that said, the position of the school is to establish a fine of $15,000 that is to be paid prior to the start of the next semester.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	145	de "[what]"
v11_start_57bccec3	de	Failure to do so, will result in you no longer being a student at San Vallejo College as well as possible legal prosecution.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	147	de "[what]"
v11_start_66950b82	lee	However, no verdict is final until all parties have had the chance to fully explain themselves.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	152	lee "[what]"
v11_start_354aba07	de	Miss Cross, you have already admitted to being guilty of what you are accused of, so personally I see little here to debate and I expect this will be a very short hearing.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	157	de "[what]"
v11_start_a6e12dcf	lee	But in fairness, regardless of anyone's personal opinions, we'll stay as long as need be. The floor is yours.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	162	lee "[what]"
v11_start_ccd53b23	u	Thank you.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	177	u "[what]"
v11_start_bdae0ebb	u	I don't wanna waste anyone's time, so let's start right away by talking about the person on trial, Penelope.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	189	u "[what]"
v11_start_8abffd5d	u	I remember the first time I met Penelope. As shy as she obviously was, she managed enough strength to approach me and introduce herself.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	194	u "[what]"
v11_start_aaaed004	u	When she did, I saw a sort of innocent kindness in her eyes. And-	game/v11/scene1.rpy	196	u "[what]"
v11_start_c19e6cbe	de	We aren't here to talk about whatever you might be seeing in her facial features, young man. Please keep your anecdotes related to Ms. Cross' actions.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	201	de "[what]"
v11_start_a71d5216	u	But that's exactly it. First impressions are actions. They're permanent marks we leave on other people. And the one Penelope leaves, is one of kindness and honesty.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	206	u "[what]"
v11_start_32234afe	u	Aren't those the values you're trying to promote? Why punish someone for acting in line with the school's values?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	208	u "[what]"
v11_start_92927cc6	u	Growing up I watched a lot of court shows so I already know what you guys are trying to do. I've seen this type of setup thousands of times.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	214	u "[what]"
v11_start_b1e49ef3	u	I may not be a real lawyer, but you won't win this case.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	216	u "[what]"
v11_start_93ef2a6b	de	Are you here to tell us about yourself or Miss Cross?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	221	de "[what]"
v11_start_d9ead10c	u	Penelope of course, but-	game/v11/scene1.rpy	226	u "[what]"
v11_start_6ca6e278	de	Good, because we'd rather stick to the situation at hand than ramble about what we watched on cable television.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	231	de "[what]"
v11_start_fa9ff11f	u	Sorry. I-	game/v11/scene1.rpy	236	u "[what]"
v11_start_921c47a3	de	San Vallejo College prides itself on our students' passion for helping each other. However that help has to be inside the boundaries of legality.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	241	de "[what]"
v11_start_2f5c9071	de	Your friend disregarded those boundaries and ended up breaking the law which is unacceptable no matter the circumstances. Should we not punish those that commit crimes?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	243	de "[what]"
v11_start_ed203484	u	Yes, criminals should be punished, but-	game/v11/scene1.rpy	253	u "[what]"
v11_start_6a3bf7d5	de	Miss Cross has already agreed that she committed a crime and you who are attempting to act as her representation say criminals should be punished.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	258	de "[what]"
v11_start_6c91d4b4	de	So by definition, Miss Cross should be punished.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	259	de "[what]"
v11_start_62e1102c	u	Yes, but the punishment you have in mind is way too serious.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	264	u "[what]"
v11_start_d6066831	de	Serious crimes result in serious punishment.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	269	de "[what]"
v11_start_d0442a1a	u	Boundaries may have been broken, but at what cost? Who was hurt in the process? No one.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	277	u "[what]"
v11_start_4d83084e	u	The intention, to help a fellow student, was pure and clearly without seeking any personal reward or benefit.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	279	u "[what]"
v11_start_3bfad6e4	u	When you care about someone, you end up doing whatever it takes to make them happy, even if it incriminates yourself.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	281	u "[what]"
v11_start_c0c7317c	u	This was not a rebellious action intending to hurt the school, but rather a selfless act of kindness that we got to witness.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	283	u "[what]"
v11_start_e60659c7	u	Punishment would convey a message of the school's disregard for students' true intentions and would therefore not be true to SVC's values.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	285	u "[what]"
v11_start_1656ec81	u	Instead, using positive reinforcement by allowing Penelope's abilities, selflessness, and intelligence to flourish in an environment beneficial to the school would be more appropriate.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	287	u "[what]"
v11_start_937d7a3c	art	*Whisper* Damn this just got interesting.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	292	art "[what]"
v11_start_f9b92192	u	What kind of school doesn't look to teach its students? Especially ones that are practically geniuses like Penelope.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	297	u "[what]"
v11_start_f5e2e697	u	She's a contribution to this college, likely she could teach us all something.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	299	u "[what]"
v11_start_6fad48b6	de	Something about hacking?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	304	de "[what]"
v11_start_4fdb36d4	lee	Computer science is an incredibly useful field nowadays.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	309	lee "[what]"
v11_start_423b2666	de	Another question, how long have you known Miss Cross and how often do you spend time with each other outside of class?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	314	de "[what]"
v11_start_a0d3a887	u	I've known Penelope for like three years now, we hang out all the time.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	324	u "[what]"
v11_start_a866a50f	de	You met her when she was at an all girl's college?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	329	de "[what]"
v11_start_8bc04366	u	That's right. My sister and Penelope went to the same school.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	334	u "[what]"
v11_start_0e086b11	pe	*Whisper* What are you doing?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	339	pe "[what]"
v11_start_4b882aaa	u	I met Penelope at the beginning of the semester right outside the cafe on Stevenson Street, since then we have seen each other a few times.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	347	u "[what]"
v11_start_9578c13e	de	And you feel these few times are enough to fully understand her character?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	352	de "[what]"
v11_start_758ac4b5	u	Anyone that spends even just a small amount of time with Penelope, could tell you how much of an amazing person she is.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	357	u "[what]"
v11_start_173d0a2e	u	You may not believe my words, but my actions of coming here and doing everything I can to defend her should prove to you how much I think of her.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	359	u "[what]"
v11_start_1d0bc5f1	de	Regardless, when it comes to education, who we are on paper is what matters most.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	364	de "[what]"
v11_start_f66b1cc5	de	We may be different behind closed doors, but San Vallejo College can only judge what we show to the outside world. Do you agree?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	366	de "[what]"
v11_start_cbe6f1fc	u	Yes, you're right. And on paper, outside of this one incident, Penelope is a honor roll student with several accolades to her name.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	378	u "[what]"
v11_start_a551b18a	u	She volunteers all the time and even the one blemish she has is just more proof of her care for others. So if on paper is what matters most, you should be agreeing with me.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	380	u "[what]"
v11_start_313bd9d8	art	*Whisper* Are we allowed to switch sides? That was a pretty good point.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	385	art "[what]"

v11_start_aa46c1ac	u	I don't, there's so much stuff about people that is never shown on paper.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	401	u "[what]"
v11_start_740e7b21	de	While that's true, what's on paper is what people decide to show the world. And your friend has shown she is willing to do whatever she must in order to get her way.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	406	de "[what]"
v11_start_b3b4de77	de	Even if that's breaking the law.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	408	de "[what]"

v11_start_7a2d8dc6	jen	Penelope is sweet, a book whiz, and she's pretty. She could have the world if she wanted, but she never thinks about herself.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	453	jen "[what]"

v11_start_14088fdc	de	I'm not certain of the equipment used to hack into the school, but based on evidence we traced and Miss Cross' own testimony we have proof that she did it. How she did it is irrelevant.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	511	de "[what]"
v11_start_11a673f9	u	Is it though? What if she just asked someone in admissions to do it, what if it wasn't actually her that did the "hacking"?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	516	u "[what]"
v11_start_119d813f	u	Would that not make a difference if an employee of the school was the one actually changing the grade?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	518	u "[what]"

v11_start_67d020f4	u	So first you claim you know everything about the case, which we've proven is false. Now you say if other information was to be revealed, Penelope's punishment would be much less severe.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	535	u "[what]"

v11_start_ae968959	pe	Yes I do.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	580	pe "[what]"
v11_start_d40bcf7b	lee	Good. So my question is this, after hearing the words of your friends I am to believe you are a kind hearted person even at the risk of yourself.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	585	lee "[what]"
v11_start_d7ab3688	lee	Knowing how complicated the admission process is, unless you were simply a magician, I don't see how you could have done it without a school official's help.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	587	lee "[what]"
v11_start_ec4c646b	lee	I fear you are withholding who aided you in an attempt to protect them. Did someone within admission help you?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	589	lee "[what]"
v11_start_be5666e0	lee	My question was not who, but if anyone. I'm not asking you to identify who helped you, I just want to know if someone did.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	599	lee "[what]"

v11s1_riley_3d9bc0ad	ri	Yeah, of course. I mentioned before that I wanted to support both of you. I've been here a while but I didn't want to walk in half way through.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	767	ri "[what]"
v11s1_riley_5b84b3ca	ri	Yeah, you guys had already started before I got here so I didn't wanna walk in. It sounded pretty heated, how did it go?	game/v11/scene1.rpy	773	ri "[what]"

v11s1_riley_7b668255	ri	So, how's Penelope? I saw her run to the restroom.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	807	ri "[what]"
v11s1_riley_a0e1818c	u	She said she was feeling sick. It didn't help that I got here late either. If it was me I'm not sure I'd be able to keep it together as well as she has.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	812	u "[what]"
v11s1_riley_3774cf7b	ri	It's probably hard for her to be optimistic at the moment.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	817	ri "[what]"
v11s1_riley_bfb8f7f6	u	Well, she didn't talk much in there to be fair. I think it's all too real. She's just now getting hit with the realization that this could have serious consequences.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	822	u "[what]"
v11s1_riley_d405d525	ri	I really wish there was something more I could do for her. It's a really bad situation, after all she only did this to help a friend in need.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	827	ri "[what]"
v11s1_riley_4a060ae8	u	I guess it's just one of those tough ethical dilemmas that you hear about in class. We should have a verdict here soon.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	832	u "[what]"

v11s1_jenny_35cd4560	u	I do too, that damn dean wouldn't let up. It stopped feeling like a hearing and more like a personal attack about half way through.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	955	u "[what]"
v11s1_jenny_2ebe2575	jen	The situation was already bad enough, but with how much she attacked Penelope it really makes me feel even worse for my part in this.	game/v11/scene1.rpy	960	jen "[what]"

v11_Amber_Penelope_5705e7b8	am	Listen, the real reason I don't want anyone knowing that I work at Lew's is because it's kind of... embarrassing. It's not really my ideal job, but it pays really well.	game/v11/scene11.rpy	43	am "[what]"

v11_Amber_Penelope_7a3ad6a8	u	So why were you asking if we could do whatever we want? Sounds oddly suspicious.	game/v11/scene11.rpy	84	u "[what]"
v11_Amber_Penelope_4127b8f0	am	So that I can do whatever I want, duh. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene11.rpy	89	am "[what]"

v11_sit_ryan_convo_3899d867_1	u	She's very intense. I don't know... When she gets attached, she's attached. But that doesn't necessarily have to mean loyal as I found out...	game/v11/scene12.rpy	260	u "[what]"
v11_sit_ryan_convo_07da59f0_1	ry	Damn. What else?	game/v11/scene12.rpy	265	ry "[what]"

v11_nora_chloe_hallway_9eefc16b	u	I'm [name]. So you're a student here?	game/v11/scene2.rpy	192	u "[what]"
v11_nora_chloe_hallway_e693042c	charli	Yeah, an exchange student. I've been here since the start of the year, but I'm living off campus so I don't know that many students.	game/v11/scene2.rpy	197	charli "[what]"
v11_nora_chloe_hallway_097e9baf	charli	Nora and I have talked a few times, but that's about it as I'm often tied up doing other things...	game/v11/scene2.rpy	198	charli "[what]"
v11_nora_chloe_hallway_59e06418	charli	So, are you going on this Europe trip? Mr. Lee invited me to go. But I'm not sure I actually want to.	game/v11/scene2.rpy	205	charli "[what]"
v11_nora_chloe_hallway_69bc0531	u	Yeah, I'll be there. What are you unsure of? It's gonna be a great time and there's some really cool events planned. Plus, you can meet all the students you haven't met.	game/v11/scene2.rpy	210	u "[what]"

v11_nora_chloe_hallway_5ba335a7	charli	Anyone you'd recommend for me to start getting to know? Or even avoid?	game/v11/scene2.rpy	237	charli "[what]"
v11_nora_chloe_hallway_cba00f62	u	Depends on the company you like to keep...	game/v11/scene2.rpy	242	u "[what]"

v11_sam_spa_07cd6b38	sa	...	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	163	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_508b0fbb	u	We don't have to if you don't want to.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	168	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_b3813b72	sa	No... it's fine. It's probably a good idea to talk about it out loud.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	173	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_349312b7	u	Seems like you're trying to make a lot of good choices. I noticed you didn't want to take a drink at the bar.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	178	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_5380372b	sa	Drinking is what started everything.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	183	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_09332657	u	What do you mean?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	188	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_7cb64328	sa	When we were young, Cameron would sneak and go get alcohol with his buddies. I caught him and my goody two shoes self said I was going to snitch.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	193	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_049a3444	u	*Chuckles* Did you just call yourself a goody two shoes?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	198	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_5781d4af	sa	I was, but secretly I wanted to try some of the stuff he was doing.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	203	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_23f0f72a	u	So I assume you didn't snitch?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	208	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_1e55d253	sa	Nope, instead I made the first bad decision I ever made and blackmailed my brother.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	213	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_5e122f38	u	Was he scared of getting caught or something, Cameron doesn't seem like the type to really care.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	218	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_2ab07597	sa	Maybe not now, but we were kids. So you can bet your ass he was scared.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	223	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_161f2ea9	u	Haha, scared of an ass whooping?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	228	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_31ee9cb5	sa	Exactly, so to continue... I bribed him and he started getting me alcohol whenever I wanted. Alcohol led to weed, weed led to this and that and well... here we are.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	233	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_bd25b413	u	You realize how much this explains right?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	238	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_3a190170	sa	What are you talking about?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	243	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_9ef52b3f	u	Cameron. It makes sense why he's always harassing you. He obviously blames himself for your addictions.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	248	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_472b9d23	sa	That's not a reason for him to helicopter me.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	253	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_2154e53f	u	Maybe not to you, but in some way it seems like he's trying to make up for his mistake.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	258	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_2edcda92	sa	I'm not his mistake.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	263	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_0613b66e	u	You may not see it that way, but think about it. He's the one that started your snowball.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	268	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_ce751d33	sa	No he's not, I made my own decisions.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	273	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_4791bb3b	u	Okay sure, you made your own decisions, but you had to be influenced by something.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	278	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_173d94f0	u	Before seeing the stuff Cameron was doing did you ever think about drinking or anything else?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	280	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_449f4623	sa	No, but...	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	285	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_dea18fb9	u	I don't wanna read too much into it, but you gotta see the connections here.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	290	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_6372b1bf	sa	I mean yeah, but he still does way too much.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	295	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_86fd0f52	u	That's how we may take it, but he may not see it that way. Especially if he blames himself for everything that happened to you.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	300	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_6b041fd2	sa	I'm an adult. Whatever decisions I make, good or bad, are my own.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	305	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_ac28087f	u	Have you ever discussed this with him?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	310	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_c93849ab	sa	I've discussed him backing the fuck off. We got into a big fight when he came here after me.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	315	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_58daaca3	u	I don't know, Sam.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	320	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_e29cb7ba	sa	I've been doing fine! The shit he's doing now is the reason for me to want a drink or something.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	325	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_26ed0377	u	So you slip when some shit happens?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	330	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_aeabcc46	sa	I wouldn't call it a slip, I didn't make some vow to be sober. I enjoy a drink and getting high every once in a while. When I feel the need to relax a bit, I do.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	335	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_1d942d70	u	Coming to a spa like this is just as good, I could fall asleep in here.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	340	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_c776043d	sa	Never fall asleep in water, it ruins your skin.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	345	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_977d0d87	u	So you're a beauty expert now too. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	350	u "[what]"

v11_sam_spa_5f87f02e	u	You're pretty cool, Sam.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	370	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_fc9ed7cb	sa	I guess you're alright, too. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	375	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_45b717b4	u	Okay... this just hit me, but if you're trying to avoid your brother why did you go to the same college?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	380	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_9e8804b0	sa	Wasn't my first choice and I planned on transferring, but I made a few friends and it didn't matter because Cameron said if I transferred he would too.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	385	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_41adf7e7	u	Okay, yeah, that's a little extra.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	390	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_cc2f76ae	sa	When is he not?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	395	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_480a0341	u	Where did you want to go to school?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	400	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_4a0cd701	sa	Rice Uni.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	405	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_ad808ca8	u	Rice? That's a pretty elite school to get into.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	410	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_78d14717	sa	I'm not stupid, [name], I have really good grades.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	415	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_20298982	u	Sam's hidden talents. *Chuckles* Who would've guessed?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	420	u "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_ad31f544	sa	Not funny. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	425	sa "[what]"
v11_sam_spa_0690924f	sa	Now I feel kinda stiff.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	435	sa "[what]"

v11s28a_galleryScene_5859c9ab	u	*Chuckles* I have to ask... We both know how Cameron warns me anytime I get close to you, so have you ever had a chance to have a boyfriend?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	516	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_133a2dc7	sa	Haha, yeah. But none of them lasted very long.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	521	sa "[what]"

v11s28a_galleryScene_2c3bd0b0	sa	Just one, poor little Justin. My most recent ex, he had it the hardest.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	531	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_b898a6eb	u	What happened?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	536	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_c61b86ea	sa	It was my senior prom. Cameron came back home to make sure "I had everything I wanted". We both know why he came though.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	541	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_41d9ec45	u	*Chuckles* Obviously.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	546	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_220bc4e2	sa	Justin was supposed to pick me up at eight, thirty minutes before the dance started. And... Well, he didn't show up on time.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	551	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_d52f5806	u	I feel like I see where this is going...	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	556	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_277a0f08	sa	I was a little embarrassed sitting at the house waiting and Cameron was getting pissed. He drove over to Justin's house, barged in and beat his ass with no questions asked.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	561	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_64115a81	sa	Come to find out, Justin's mother had a really bad accident that night and he was trying to handle it all.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	563	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_d6944590	u	*Laughs* I'm so sorry... that's fucking crazy. What happened to Cameron?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	568	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_6777e775	sa	They called the police and he spent the night in jail, but the family decided not to press charges after I begged them.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	573	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_c7579243	sa	Justin ended up breaking up with me and I haven't dated anyone since.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	575	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_2043c967	u	Cameron takes things a lot further than I thought.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	580	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_01db5af4	sa	Now you get it. So basically, I'll never have a life of my own because my brother is crazy.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	585	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_32f696f1	sa	I thought about getting a restraining order before, but my mom went crazy when I said it.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	587	sa "[what]"

v11s28a_galleryScene_46f48680	u	She cheated on me and recently said she doesn't want to talk to me or see me anymore so no point in talking about her, but I can tell you about another girl.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	612	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_d10f0ac4	sa	Go on.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	617	sa "[what]"

v11s28a_galleryScene_1d930449	u	...I never really had time for her. I was busy having fun and doing a bunch of other shit that she just became a side story to the main quest.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	691	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_bf3e4647	sa	If something doesn't work out it's because it wasn't meant to.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	696	sa "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_07433087	u	So you feel you and Justin weren't meant to be?	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	701	u "[what]"
v11s28a_galleryScene_7f4b77c5	sa	Oh, haha. No way. He was too soft for me. He tried to plead with my brother when he was getting his ass whooped instead of fighting back.	game/v11/scene28a.rpy	706	sa "[what]"

v11_lindsey_park_b0b78439	li	Yeah, I'm just enjoying the park. There really is no better place than a good park. My mother and I used to go to parks all the time...	game/v11/scene31.rpy	25	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_a80353b0	u	I have to be honest, the connection that you have with your mother is pretty amazing. And I'm glad you value it too.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	30	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_dd1542f5	li	Of course. She played so many roles in my life it'd be hard not to.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	35	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_c25f46cb	u	I wish more people valued the relationships they build with others.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	40	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_695c8257	li	Are you talking about anyone specifically?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	45	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_e10803ea	u	No, I just mean in general. I think a lot of people take more for granted than they should.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	50	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_dfeaa4b9	li	Well, sometimes people just don't know [name]. I was lucky enough to have a mother that made sure I knew how much she loved me, but some people don't have that.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	55	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_efbc56c4	li	Some people have others in their life that they care for deeply, but show it so poorly that those people never really know.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	60	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_b1e4000f	u	Hmm... You're pretty insightful, Lindsey.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	65	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_411faccb	li	Woah, no Linds? I just started getting used to it. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene31.rpy	70	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_542a1357	u	Haha, well... It felt like a serious moment.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	75	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_0b51306e	li	Speaking of serious, I've made a pretty big decision.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	80	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_57258cce	u	What's that?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	85	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_f08c45e4	li	I'm one hundred percent certain that I'm running against Chloe to be Chicks President.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	90	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_6d5778af	u	Wow... congrats! What made you decide?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	95	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_40f1b01c	li	Honestly, she did. I sat and spoke with her about some of the Nora drama and how the rest of the girls feel about it and rather than taking any responsibility she blamed everything on Nora.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	100	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_536347a0	li	I tried getting her to see some of the things she's done that have contributed to the problem, but she's blind to all of that. She genuinely believes she's done nothing wrong.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	105	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_b449531a	u	Is it possible that with all the responsibility she has, it's hard for her to see her mistakes?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	116	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_2c8aeb7f	u	I couldn't begin to guess what's led her to see things like that.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	123	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_cb45e92f	li	Regardless, any excuse is a bad excuse. And I don't want this to affect our friendship, but I can't let our feelings get in the way of doing what's right.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	128	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_e1820692	u	I feel like your friendship is the key to all of this. Rather than running against her, maybe you should be trying to use your friendship as leverage to talk to her.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	139	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_7cc89f5b	li	Like I said, I already tried that and she can't see past her ego. Don't get me wrong, I love Chloe... She's one of my best friends, I know her very well.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	144	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_26acbe99	li	And so I know this is the only way... unfortunate as it is.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	146	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_295a7285	u	*Sighs* I just hope this doesn't make things worse or really hurt Chloe if she loses.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	151	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_f64a5d39	li	I'll make sure Chloe is taken care of, she's still my friend [name].	game/v11/scene31.rpy	156	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_dace3a15	u	I'm gonna hold you to that.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	161	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_9d827d15	li	Always down for being held accountable.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	166	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_6834bfb6	u	I'm down to support you as long as all of this means a new beginning for the Chicks. I'm not in the business of switching out one problem for another, get what I'm saying?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	178	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_277ea261	li	I hear you, and I want to make that clear to the girls too.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	183	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_5d0bfb65	li	Chloe does too much without the input of the rest of the Chicks, no one is there to hold her accountable because no one knows what's going on. Not even Aubrey and she's the VP.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	188	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_f98c600b	u	So you want to have sort of an open criticism policy?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	193	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_b2faa5ff	li	Of course, that's the only way to make sure everyone, or mostly everyone, is happy or approves of the decisions you are making as a leader.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	198	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_e96c4eb6	u	Seems like you have your mind set, so how does this all work?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	203	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_35e59b1a	li	Normally, we don't have these issues so the presidency is just passed on to whoever the former President wants.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	208	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_fcb5342e	li	Who they choose or endorse rather is always approved by everyone else.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	210	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_f8173285	u	How often do you all decide on a new President?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	215	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_61cce069	li	Every half semester we do a vote, but no one ever runs against the current President.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	220	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_a47f4cf4	li	So from what I've learned, people just suck up to the President and hope they're chosen when the President leaves.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	222	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_857b0ad3	u	So, you're gonna run against Chloe when we get back?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	227	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_578c21cb	li	Yep, but the Chicks have never had multiple candidates before so there's no precedent on how this will go. So, I'm taking upon myself to do this the only way I know how.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	232	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_085d4521	u	And how is that?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	237	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_c561b9e3	li	My way.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	242	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_f10b11d3	u	*Laughs* And what's your way?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	247	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_6c3d789d	li	I want to run a full campaign and really show the girls why I should be President.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	252	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_8156370e	u	How does that work?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	257	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_67d1c64e	li	Well, it starts with me knowing why I want to be President and putting it into a concise message.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	262	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_71d300e4	u	So... a slogan?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	267	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_1bcbcb7a	li	Exactly, but I'm having trouble coming up with one. I actually planned on meeting with Charli and talking about it, he had some really good ideas.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	272	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_6759674f	u	Well, I can help with that. If someone was to ask, like if you were in an interview or something, why do you want to be the Chicks President? What would you say?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	277	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_e310f053	li	Well, in the time that I've been a member of the Chicks, most of what I was led to believe was true is not.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	282	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_5d37e084	li	There isn't a strong sense of forever lasting friendship, there isn't women empowerment, there isn't a lot. So, I want to make the promise we were all given come true.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	283	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_ca0dc500	li	That's why I want to be President.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	288	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_c075d6fa	u	Damn, that was some genuine presidential stuff right there. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene31.rpy	293	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_d23d28a5	li	*Laughs* I was just being honest.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	298	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_b63040ba	u	That gives me an idea for a slogan too.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	303	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_a18f046f	li	What?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	308	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_a86ea395	u	Lindsey, Returning The Promise. What do you think?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	320	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_49599711	u	Lindsey, Say Bye To The Bullshit. What do you think?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	328	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_f68ff19f	li	Did you just come up with that off the top of your head?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	333	li "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_b691736c	u	Well yeah, do you not like it?	game/v11/scene31.rpy	338	u "[what]"
v11_lindsey_park_b6f60d13	li	No, I love it! I'm just surprised you were able to just come up with a good slogan so quickly.	game/v11/scene31.rpy	343	li "[what]"

v11_walk_park_050d63a0	lee	It took some time, a few disciplinary actions and so forth, before I finally realized what was going on. And you'll probably be surprised by what it was.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	92	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_ef2f1671	u	What?	game/v11/scene37.rpy	97	u "[what]"
v11_walk_park_6e16e2b3	lee	*Chuckles* I was bored. I wasn't a bad student and it's not that I liked drama, I was just really bored.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	102	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_786fd428	lee	And I'll be honest, I can't even remember what the guy's name was, but I do remember that he made a joke about me in class one time and embarrassed me in front of this girl I liked.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	107	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_e5f20d2c	lee	From that point on I looked at him as a rival. At first you could've called it revenge, but after you get somebody so many times... you're just being, excuse my language but, an ass.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	112	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_76937d90	imre	Woah, Mr. Lee with the cuss words...	game/v11/scene37.rpy	117	imre "[what]"
v11_walk_park_2fd33efb	lee	I just want you boys to realize that I've already done everything you're doing right now. I wish back then I had a teacher that cared to interfere and help rather than just punishing us and moving on.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	122	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_1ed2af07	lee	Not only that, but you both have a mutual friend here in [name].	game/v11/scene37.rpy	127	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_57a317c0	lee	If he can find a way to be friends with you both despite you two being in different fraternities and having a dispute, then I'm sure you two could try and get along.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	132	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_0f9a23df	u	Why are you guys even fighting?	game/v11/scene37.rpy	137	u "[what]"
v11_walk_park_dd58893f	imre	Because... At the brawl Ryan and Grayson were talking a bunch of shit.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	142	imre "[what]"
v11_walk_park_229ff206	ry	I wasn't talking shit, I just laughed at what Grayson said.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	147	ry "[what]"
v11_walk_park_ea27a9f9	imre	If you laughed you must've thought it was funny, so we have a problem.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	152	imre "[what]"
v11_walk_park_ee116fa8	ry	Shouldn't you be mad at Grayson? *Chuckles* That's exactly what it is! You're scared of him so you settle for shitting on me.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	157	ry "[what]"
v11_walk_park_d750399f	imre	I'm not scared of shit, we can go right now.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	162	imre "[what]"
v11_walk_park_5286905b	u	Guys, chill.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	167	u "[what]"
v11_walk_park_9edc52a2	imre	I'm not gonna chill. He thinks I'm scared so I'll show him I'm not.	game/v11/scene37.rpy	172	imre "[what]"
v11_walk_park_447272cf	lee	SHUT THE HELL UP! YOU ARE JUST A BUNCH OF CHILDREN! IF YOU CAN'T APPRECIATE WHAT I'M DOING, THEN I'LL DO NOTHING AND YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN!	game/v11/scene37.rpy	177	lee "[what]"
v11_walk_park_8adaa1e2	u	Mr. Lee...	game/v11/scene37.rpy	182	u "[what]"
v11_walk_park_483f0897	ry	And you ruin the day once again...	game/v11/scene37.rpy	192	ry "[what]"
v11_walk_park_27a93b2d	imre	Bro, shut the fuck up. How are we gonna get home?	game/v11/scene37.rpy	197	imre "[what]"
v11_walk_or_ride_5ca2669d	u	Mr. Lee, wait up!	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	15	u "[what]"
v11_walk_or_ride_665d7c5c	u	(*Sighs* This is some bullshit.)	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	20	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_49d894ad	u	You're just going to leave them out here?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	33	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_cc3ce54f	lee	Why not? They're grown men and have made it clear that they have no interest in doing anything I suggest, so I'll just excuse myself. Did you not want to stay with them?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	38	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_b11c4a26	u	I'd rather not listen to them fight all the way back to the hotel.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	43	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_c45377bd	lee	*Sighs* I guess you're a little bit more mature than your friends. Either that or you just wanted a ride.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	48	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_d1f206e7	u	*Laughs* A little bit of both.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	53	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_43629334	lee	I appreciate the honesty. I have a question if you'll indulge me.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	58	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_37fe551f	u	Sure.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	63	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_3488b28e	lee	If I was to ask which of those two boys you felt you had more in common with, who would you say?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	68	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_32a18ab0	u	I'd probably say Imre.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	75	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_de3249e8	u	I'd probably say Ryan.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	78	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_48b29642	lee	I ask you that question because both of those boys have their personalities written on their forehead.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	83	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_4156ea0e	lee	Imre clearly speaks his mind without much care, he's loyal to a fault, but can't tolerate being betrayed or disrespected. Though at times even he betrays or disrespects others.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	84	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_bad9efb4	u	(Does he know something about Imre that I don't?)	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	89	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_b9036c5b	u	What about Ryan?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	90	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_2519737e	lee	Ryan is more complicated, yet still clear enough. He is a reactor rather than an actor such as Imre is. Ryan doesn't tell the world how to move.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	95	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_2365a16b	lee	He watches the world move and then decides what he'll do. Look at them right now.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	96	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_0b4c5759	lee	Ask yourself, if Imre had never said a word during the multiple times they went at it, would they have gone at it at all?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	104	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_41d104ad	u	No, probably not. Are you trying to say it's all Imre's fault?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	109	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_df64cced	lee	Not at all. If I'm punching near your face and you put your head directly in the path of one of my blows then that's your fault.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	114	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_51ae5f42	lee	Ryan lets Imre bother him. He could easily "be the better man" and walk away, but he doesn't because they act like children.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	115	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_19bc0e56	lee	[name], do you know what it means to be a man and act as an adult?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	125	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_45c88e10	u	Well, those that have responsibilities don't have a choice but to act like an adult so I guess having responsibility.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	132	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_e45dbf73	u	Well, to be either of those you have to act mature.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	135	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_b8e551d5	lee	To be a man, to be an adult, it's imperative that we are aware of our position and act accordingly. If you are a husband, father, and employee then you must be aware of that and act accordingly.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	140	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_a0ca5a77	lee	You and all of your friends are students that are under mine and Ms. Rose's care.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	145	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_c7fca150	lee	So to act accordingly means to behave as if you were at school and follow any appropriate and reasonable instructions we give. Your two friends back there don't understand that.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	150	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_ac67b2f0	u	Yeah, it was getting pretty hard to handle them.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	155	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_3a9b280c	lee	That would be an understatement. Maybe being forced to work together on finding a way home will help them with their issues.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	160	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_0d610aa1	lee	This is exactly why I despise modern day Greek culture. It destroys morality in place of loyalty.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	161	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_606fc3b0	u	Were you in a fraternity?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	166	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_f8b3330d	lee	I was, and proud to be. It was nothing like the fraternities we have today. If I had a say in how things were run at our school, it would be quite different.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	171	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_b450e9d8	u	(Good thing you don't have a say.)	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	176	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_df706c18	lee	Honestly, what do you get out of being in a fraternity?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	181	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_8f1ce968	u	You mean me, personally?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	186	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_dab23651	lee	Yes, you. What do you get out of it? As a matter of fact, I asked Imre this same question before he pledged to the Wolves and I wasn't too happy with his answer.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	191	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_4d1ac691	u	What he'd say?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	196	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_e1af09c8	lee	That's neither here nor there, but I'll tell you this, if you say anything about girls being your reason I'll let you out to walk the rest of the way right now.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	201	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_fcc18885	u	*Laughs*	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	206	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_bad5d485	u	I enjoy the brotherhood, really. At the end of the day I know they all have my back.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	210	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_e83a44f2	u	Well honestly, I enjoy the excitement. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to join a frat, but I'm glad I did.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	213	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_eb8c677d	u	You never know what to expect and regardless of what crazy things may happen, at least you can never say you're bored. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	214	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_dba4031e	lee	Well, that's definitely a better answer than I've been given before.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	219	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_3eb6c121	u	Mr. Lee, I have to ask. Why does this whole thing matter to you so much that you were willing to drag us all the way out here just to smooth things over?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	224	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_593b095c	u	Any other teacher would've just separated, disciplined, and called it a day.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	225	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_dcd30c55	lee	*Sighs* As I was trying to explain earlier, I see much of my younger self in the situations that you students experience.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	230	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_7609c2ed	lee	If I'm able to help one of you or all of you, that makes it worth it. But I'm not going to babysit anyone. Instead, I'll give you all clarity and a fair shot.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	231	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_f881cded	lee	It may not sound like much when I put it that way, but most never even get that.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	236	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_c68c4649	u	No I get it, that's actually really cool of you. I really respect that.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	241	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_7df915ef	lee	Let me tell you something [name], in our lives we make mistakes, and we also make choices that in our opinion aren't mistakes, but others are hurt by them.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	246	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_86caaf18	lee	Listen closely to what I'm about to say.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	251	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_93c1e437	lee	Don't regret the decisions you've made up to this point in your life. Own your decisions and remember that the world will go on regardless of what you do.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	256	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_0453f93c	lee	So enjoy your life. Walking around regretting the past will just ruin your future. The past is the past, the future is the future, but right here, right now... this is a gift.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	257	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_4d07234a	lee	That's why it's called the present. Don't let others ruin your present. Do you understand what I'm saying?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	262	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_78d3c42b	u	(Does he know everything that's going on?)	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	267	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_52127ebb	u	Pretty sure that's exactly what I needed to hear Mr. Lee. I've been going through a lot lately and some self reflecting has been a part of it.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	268	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_275324ad	lee	I know [name], I know.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	273	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_302362af	u	Wait, you know about... everything?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	278	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_d0173461	lee	Let me clarify... I don't know exactly what's going on, but you're my student. If I didn't notice a change in your behavior or interactions with other students I'd be a poor professor.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	283	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_5cfa34ad	lee	I've noticed some of your conversations with one particular student and I've seen you acting a bit unlike yourself lately. Just live your life, okay? A mature, responsible life, but your life.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	284	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_50f6cedd	u	Yeah, for sure. Um, thank you Mr. Lee, really.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	289	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_69cf1ac4	lee	Thank you for actually listening. Being in teaching for years really helps you learn to know if people are actually listening to you or not.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	294	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_f29ea128	lee	We're pulling up to the hotel, I'll let you enjoy the rest of your day. We do have a group event tonight, just so you know.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	295	lee "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_51518e19	u	Cool, thanks again Mr. Lee.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	300	u "[what]"
v11_ride_with_mrlee_9c0fd9b0	u	(I really respect that guy.)	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	310	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_9eb6fbd8	u	Honestly, I can't be mad at him for this. What is wrong with you guys? That was fucking embarrassing.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	323	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_7991279d	u	You do realize he's going to get back to the hotel alone and people are going to be asking him where we are? What's he going to say, that we all went out for coffee?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	324	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_b4a5c1f5	ry	Bro, relax. I already said I'm sorry that you got dragged into this mess. We just need to get back before Mr. Lee does or come up with a story explaining where we've been.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	329	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_5e8c252f	imre	Why don't you take responsibility? This is your fault.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	334	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_089aaa9f	ry	How is it my fault?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	339	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_62a094da	imre	Like I said before, if you didn't talk shit about me, we wouldn't have any issues outside of the fact that you're an Ape.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	344	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_ca492e2f	u	I'm an Ape too.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	350	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_ab388832	imre	That's another problem, for another time.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	355	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_92007a48	ry	I WASN'T MAKING FUN OF YOU! YOUR DUMB ASS DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE FUCK GRAYSON SAID, DO YOU?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	360	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_20d58588	imre	I don't need to know what he said, I know he was talking about me and you thought the shit was funny, end of story.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	365	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_dc90c713	ry	I swear you Wolves are fucking idiots.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	370	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_4eb4cf52	u	Bro, chill with the frat insults.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	376	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_bf2b8e17	ry	Sorry, but he's pissing me off.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	381	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_6fcdcaa3	imre	If it wasn't anything bad and I'm acting crazy then tell me what he said.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	386	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_b5f95b28	ry	I don't have to tell you what he said.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	391	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_61920305	imre	No, you really do. If he didn't say anything bad about me and you weren't a part of the joke or whatever it was, I'll apologize and this will all be over.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	396	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_12ade722	ry	I don't even remember.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	401	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_108f9b54	u	Ryan, really? You remember what he said.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	411	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_6566c322	u	If he doesn't even remember it must not have been that serious.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	417	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_d6929f78	imre	What? You can't start believing his bullshit too. What did Grayson say, Ryan?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	422	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_0b5d8ee4	ry	*Sighs* Fine. Grayson said, and I'm quoting him, these are his words not mine. "Imre is a sorry ass fighter just like his brother was. I'd be surprised if he makes it thirty seconds.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	427	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_f3b0f600	ry	The only time he works hard is if there's pussy involved." It was at that point that I laughed.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	428	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_e706d9b8	u	So you didn't even say anything?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	433	u "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_6410301e	ry	No, that's what I've been saying this whole time.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	438	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_ed82b317	imre	Well you should have, I knew you guys were talking about my brother and that's what really pissed me off. You should've said something to Grayson or at least not laughed.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	443	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_46832b4f	ry	You, your brother, and Grayson-all of that is none of my business. That obviously wasn't the reason I laughed.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	448	ry "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_b3bd22a3	imre	You shouldn't have laughed at all. You should've either said something about him talking shit or stayed quiet.	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	453	imre "[what]"
v11_imre_and_ryan_d2e9d857	ry	Okay bitch, what now? It's done and over with so what now?	game/v11/scene37a.rpy	458	ry "[what]"

v11_mc_amber_gokart_f9d62472	clerk	Oh, no reason... Just curious. But um, yeah, the track is closed. Although, maybe for a fine dime like you I'll get it up and running...	game/v11/scene39.rpy	174	clerk "[what]"

v11_mc_amber_gokart_54ff2306	am	Haha! Hey. He can be whatever he wants as long as we get to use those karts, plus it didn't sound like he was gonna make us pay.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	199	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_df9f7f45	u	I guess being pretty pays after all, huh?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	204	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_de1242b4	am	Oh... So, that's why you're broke? *Laughs*	game/v11/scene39.rpy	209	am "[what]"

v11_mc_amber_gokart_74567c89	u	Come on, you definitely don't want that. *Chuckles* Wait, is it gonna be like a selfie or what?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	244	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_3f799d60	am	Haha, I hadn't even thought about that. How about when I win, I get to take the picture myself and I'll send it to you. That way if you don't post it, I will.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	249	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_9999012b	u	Wow. This bet just got way more serious than I thought it'd be.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	254	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_03f2ef49	am	If it wasn't a serious bet there'd be no point in having it. But don't worry, if I lose you get to take my picture too. Same rules for both of us.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	259	am "[what]"

v11_mc_amber_gokart_17bec5ff	am	Oh... Um, okay. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene39.rpy	319	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_ea8e4469	clerk	I'm not like- crazy or anything, okay? You don't think I'm crazy, do you? It's really not cool to assume things about people.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	324	clerk "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_d587b4e0	am	N-no! You're alright dude, I don't think you're crazy.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	329	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_710286a2	clerk	Okay good... I could've killed the last person that called me crazy. I didn't kill him but, I could've you know?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	334	clerk "[what]"

v11_mc_amber_gokart_6bfb489c	clerk	Wear these. You can just put them over the clothes you're wearing. They're for extra protection in the event of a crash.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	354	clerk "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_1fd32263	u	A crash? How often does that happen?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	359	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_0bc0be85	clerk	A lot.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	364	clerk "[what]"

v11_mc_amber_gokart_f6fdb91b	u	Haha, let's do this.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	384	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_402ebed1	am	That guy is fucking crazy. *Laughs*	game/v11/scene39.rpy	394	am "[what]"

v11_mc_amber_gokart_b6078ee6	am	Haha, we look like we're getting ready to rob a bank. I'm pretty sure we could if we really wanted to, especially here in another country, as students on a trip. No one would suspect us, you know that... right?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	419	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_72e86c9d	am	I wonder who else we could get in on it... maybe Riley. *Chuckles* If anything went south we could use her as the fall guy. She's hot and all, but definitely the perfect fall guy.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	420	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_512cc825	u	Sounds like an interesting plan, but you have to promise that if we're successful, we'll visit Riley in prison until the day she gets out.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	428	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_c27d0b9c	am	Sorry [name], but that's not gonna happen. It's way too risky visiting the person who takes the fall. Can't even do calls, actually. The most I can do is fake cry during any interviews.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	433	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_3ed5a48c	u	That's cold...	game/v11/scene39.rpy	438	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_45a1e536	am	We all have to play a role, and if you can't play yours then unfortunately you and Riley will both be doing ten to twenty years in the slammer.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	443	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_fbc897d3	u	*Chuckles* Wow Amber, you've really thought this whole thing through, huh?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	448	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_5cc8f33d	am	Just a little in my spare time. *Chuckles* Let's do this race.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	453	am "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_25ee0a06	u	Nah, I'm good. I'm way too handsome for jail.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	463	u "[what]"
v11_mc_amber_gokart_d72275e2	am	"Nice to meet you guys, my name's [name] and I didn't see myself going to prison, but I'm gonna do whatever I gotta do to make it."	game/v11/scene39.rpy	468	am "[what]"

v11_race_continue3_9c5a8136	clerk	Babe? I didn't call you babe! I don't even like girls like you, you're definitely not my type. You're like a six if that. *Laughs*	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1017	clerk "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_8350a957	am	I'm-	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1031	am "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_96dcf4fe	u	What the fuck is your problem? Who do you think you are talking to her like that? Your ugly ass probably never pleased a girl in his life.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1036	u "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_abd0e216	clerk	I didn't mean it like that, I was just saying-	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1041	clerk "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_3b4179ed	u	Don't "just say" anything. Let's go, Amber.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1046	u "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_3598fcaa	u	What's wrong?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1056	u "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_e5b5b9b6	clerk	Hey, that's not appropriate for a public-	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1068	clerk "[what]"

v11_race_continue3_e9ec6451	u	He doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about, Amber. You know that.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1126	u "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_72992908_1	u	At least we both had a good time, right?	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1131	u "[what]"

v11_race_continue3_ef772a01	u	You know what, if the job at Lew's doesn't work out, maybe you can work with our friend back there.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1146	u "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_5672d6d5	u	You know, stare into each other's eyes while you countdown for customers. That sounds nice, doesn't it? *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1151	u "[what]"
v11_race_continue3_7be577eb	am	Yeah, sounds like a fucking dream.	game/v11/scene39.rpy	1156	am "[what]"

v11_wolves_packing_chris_a9bbd552	ch	Hey man, saw you come home. You usually aren't here around this time and everyone else is out. What are you up to?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	20	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_90de0a42	u	I'm just getting things situated for the trip. You already packed up?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	27	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_9efedfed	ch	Yeah, I packed last week except for bathroom stuff.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	32	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_7d3b23e0	u	Ahh that was smart, I don't know what I was doing. I thought we still had another week.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	37	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_53eeae4c	ch	*Sigh* You wouldn't be the only one lately that doesn't know what they're doing.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	42	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_09332657	u	What do you mean?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	47	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_af9bedb2	ch	*Sighs*	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	52	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_3598fcaa	u	What's wrong?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	57	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_9eed0439	ch	It's Nora... Her and I are having some... issues.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	62	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_fdbce207	u	Oh...	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	67	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_46092ce9	ch	You don't mind me opening up to you do you? I just really haven't had a chance to vent.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	72	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_e0469f9d	u	Of course, I don't mind.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	82	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_2d670b18	ch	Let me ask you this, do you think Nora and I are right for each other?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	87	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_2df276c5	u	Of course, I couldn't see you guys without each other.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	97	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_7c0050ed	u	I wouldn't wanna try and play matchmaker or anything. So I don't really know.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	103	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_1d89bf42	ch	Right now, I have no idea.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	108	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_2bd0c892	ch	The last time I saw her smile was at homecoming and that was only for a moment. And even that night didn't end well.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	110	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_ee065306	u	What's causing you guys to have problems?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	115	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_66f53efe	ch	It's a whole mess really. I love Nora, more than anything. She's been there for me in ways I can't even explain.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	120	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_a35e17a3	ch	I've known her forever. I mean, we've been dating since high school. But ever since I became Wolves President it's like I'm being torn two ways.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	122	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_5a11bca8	ch	It seems impossible for me to do everything I need to do for the frat and still give Nora the attention she deserves.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	124	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_ab9dcb8d	ch	I've tried explaining to her that this is just temporary, but that didn't really make things better.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	126	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_dee1bc2d	u	I get it, sometimes it's hard to know what the right thing to do is... But can you blame her for being upset that you're prioritizing the frat?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	131	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_0d7beee8	ch	That's just it, I can't. I completely understand her point of view and I wish things were different, but they can't be while I'm President.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	136	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_99dede0f	u	Sounds like the best thing to do is just sit down and talk with her.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	145	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_a0ef100e	ch	Believe me, I've tried. We just see things differently. There's no getting her to understand, all I can do is hope she hangs in there while my time in the frat lasts.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	150	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_b5f0d752	u	She may not be willing to make that sacrifice. What then?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	155	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_e090040b	ch	Then I lose the love of my life. My grandfather used to say "we can love people all we want, but if we can't provide for those we love then we don't love them at all".	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	160	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_fa4fd6f6	ch	This frat opens so many doors for me. Job opportunities, leadership programs, scholarships... All I need to do is finish what I've started.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	162	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_c9def445	u	Does Nora know all of this?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	167	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_5a1df7ab	ch	*Sighs* Yes, but she- she doesn't care. She feels I can still do better and that I'm using the frat as an excuse.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	172	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_5c61a192	u	Maybe on the trip you'll have the chance to get that spark back.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	177	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_42e653a1	ch	I wish, but I don't think that's gonna happen either.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	182	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_66495e60	u	How come?	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	187	u "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_c6feb4d0	ch	I'm only going on the trip because I need it to graduate. Otherwise I'd be staying to take care of things for the frat, we have some major things coming up.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	192	ch "[what]"
v11_wolves_packing_chris_cd8e8272	ch	I'm gonna be spending most of the trip on the phone with Sebastian. And I don't think that's gonna solve our issues.	game/v11/scene3a.rpy	194	ch "[what]"

v11_cafe_with_riley_4f086ef9	u	No I don't mind at all, I'll be there soon.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	24	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_ac04ba6e	ri	Okay cool, thanks. See ya.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	29	ri "[what]"

v11_cafe_with_riley_a40af0da	ri	Hey.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	90	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_485f63b5	u	So, how do you wanna do this? A little small talk first or just dive right in?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	95	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_21e4eccb	ri	Haha, I don't wanna keep you forever so I'll just say what's on my mind... I'm kinda nervous about the trip, actually.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	100	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_48c99239	u	Why?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	105	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_722c1512	ri	Wait, let me rephrase that... I'm kinda nervous about flying to Europe.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	110	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_4433d913	u	What's got you so freaked out?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	115	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_9f3a1855	ri	I've never flown before and I don't know what to expect. Will I get sick? Are there going to be a lot of issues with the plane?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	120	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_ad547709	ri	I literally know nothing except for the things I've seen in movies. And in movies, there's no middle man. It's either the plane crashes or people are enjoying themselves in first class.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	121	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_13918ced	ri	And although one of those would be nice, it won't be happening... So I really hope the plane doesn't crash.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	122	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_79067112	u	Well... Planes don't crash often, but there's usually a lot of turbulence which makes the plane shake pretty hard. That part is a little scary.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	130	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_41f33989	u	It's mostly stable in first class, but in the regular area where we'll be, it can get kinda bad.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	131	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_bfaa40a4	ri	That doesn't make me feel any better...	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	136	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_b2109baa	u	Haha, I'm just messing with you. It's really not that bad. You probably won't even notice we're moving.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	141	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_fe691d49	ri	Amber also said the turbulence makes the plane shake a lot... Now I feel like you're just trying to make me feel better by hiding the truth.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	146	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_d483f6a8	u	*Laughs* Well, the truth is I was trying to scare you with something that would be believable. Sounds like Amber had the same idea.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	151	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_da8ea1c2	u	Just download some movies on your phone to watch and for most of it, you'll probably be asleep anyway... You really have nothing to worry about.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	152	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_0473c8f4	u	I'm pretty sure Imre is scared of heights, but he has no problem with the plane.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	153	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_bc038785	u	*Chuckles* If you need someone to hold your hand for the whole flight I will, but you really have nothing to worry about.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	159	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_73b86659	u	I've been on multiple planes and know many others that have flown, and we've never had any problems. I just watch movies and sleep the whole time.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	160	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_ed5df938	ri	Be really honest though, what's the worst thing about it?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	165	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_1c8b7795	u	Well, the elevation messes with your ears a bit. Kinda feels like you're underwater. You get rid of it by yawning, but your ears sort of pop. For myself and most people that's the worst part.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	170	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_ac18688a	ri	Your ears pop?! Does it hurt?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	175	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_a03e22ac	u	Haha, no Riley, it doesn't hurt. It's just an unusual feeling. I'm sure you've popped your knuckles before. It's like that but with your ear.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	180	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_62ac0c70	ri	Okay, I guess that doesn't seem so bad.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	185	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_b4ad2879	u	See? Nothing to stress over.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	190	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_bdc341b1	ri	Alright, I guess I shouldn't worry about it. I am gonna talk to Amber though because I know she tried to scare me with her "make sure you tuck your feet under the seat so you don't fall out". *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	195	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_4b3eb010	u	*Laughs* Yeah, talking to Amber about your fears probably wasn't a good idea. If I had never flown before and talked to Amber before my first time, I'd be nervous too. She has that kind of power.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	200	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_17ced004	ri	We should call her Maleficent... *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	205	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_ff499cd4	u	What's maleficent?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	210	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_a449cba2	ri	Oh my god, look it up later.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	215	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_41b9ee1a	u	*Chuckles* Okay? Hey, I know a way you could get over your fear of flying pretty easily.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	220	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_ca130271	ri	Really? How?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	225	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_2623d696	u	You should try out that little indoor skydiving thing.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	230	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_7949f754	ri	What?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	235	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_35e3b2f4	u	You know, the thing with the giant air tube that lets you float?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	240	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_736c6c0f	ri	Oh, right! I saw a commercial about that, I did think it kinda looked fun.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	245	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_6400f3c1	u	Well, it's safe and probably more stressful than an actual plane ride.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	250	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_a6581dea	ri	Maybe less stressful for you. *Laughs*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	255	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_18930abe	charli	Hey [name]! Is this one of the close friends you were telling me about? I love your hair! Is that color natural?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	265	charli "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_a2c4ca94	ri	Oh, thank you so much! I'm Riley. And yeah, haha. it's natural... You're a friend of [name]?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	270	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_15ce87e8	charli	Yea- well... I don't know, actually. *Chuckles* Would you say we're friends [name]?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	275	charli "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_b222b29c	u	Haha, maybe not yet, I mean we just met this morning...	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	282	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_a77065ae	u	Sure, of course. Charli and I actually just met this morning.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	289	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_40660b45	ri	Well, it's nice to meet you, Charli. Love your energy, so positive.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	294	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_61d92fd9	charli	It's my pleasure, really. I was just telling [name] that I needed to find some friends on campus and here you are. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	299	charli "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_22824727	ri	Haha, yes. Here I am. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	304	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_b59b263a	u	Charli here is actually going on the Europe trip with us.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	309	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_a22e33b5	ri	Oh yayyy! Now I won't be stuck with just [name]. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	314	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_cb51324b	u	Wowww... *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	319	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_477fb607	charli	[name] you must be one hell of a guy considering you're surrounded by all these amazing people...	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	324	charli "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_4cc21c21	ri	"Amazing"? Definitely not. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	329	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_ce575d5b	u	("Amazing"...)	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	334	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_6639c906	ri	How come I've never bumped into you before?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	339	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_2376aa9d	charli	I'm actually an exchange student and I currently stay off campus. But honestly I would have made more of an effort to meet people on campus if I had known you guys were here. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	344	charli "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_7516831a	ri	Ahh... that would explain a lot... Well, I'm really glad you're going on the trip with us. That'll give us the perfect chance to get to know each other.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	349	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_3895912a	charli	I'm looking forward to it! I actually wasn't going to go, but [name] convinced me.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	354	charli "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_8ef0b6cc	ri	Well in that case, thank you [name]! *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	359	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_41b4a17c	charli	I should finish getting ready for the long flight tomorrow. See you guys!	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	364	charli "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_59b2f8e8	u	Later man.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	369	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_d3e22b30	u	Someone found a new best friend.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	374	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_99af0934	ri	Oh don't say it like that, he's sweet. Maybe girls would call you sweet too if you paid them a compliment every once in a while.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	379	ri "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_b9ae452b	u	I do give compliments!	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	384	u "[what]"

v11_cafe_with_riley_3639a878	u	I'm not jealous, just surprised to see you hit it off like that.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	394	u "[what]"
v11_cafe_with_riley_4231ea00	ri	Maybe I thought he was cute?	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	399	ri "[what]"

v11_cafe_with_riley_093afd15	ri	*Laughs* I'm gonna get on out of here. And now that I think about it, flying is the last thing on my mind, so thank you.	game/v11/scene3b.rpy	409	ri "[what]"

v11_carriage_ride_15fe988e	li	It might as well be! I love ice cream, but it always bothers my teeth so I can never eat too much. Do you know how much ice cream I'd eat if it didn't hurt so much?	game/v11/scene40.rpy	358	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_3ddff3de	no	Probably a lot.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	363	no "[what]"

v11_carriage_ride_85f477bf	li	Okay, so as you two know, when we're recruited into the Chicks we're told that though we are sisters, and always have this in common, we still must celebrate our individual differences.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	413	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_e352dd7f	li	I want to take that belief and go deeper. I studied a bit with Ms. Rose, who come to find out, was also in a sorority during college, and she said they all had nicknames.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	418	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_cb2462a4	no	What kind of nicknames?	game/v11/scene40.rpy	423	no "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_b7048466	li	The nicknames are based upon your personality, things you do, etc. And you don't get to choose your nickname, your sisters come up with ideas and they vote on a name for you.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	428	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_8a4bfe68	li	I spoke to some of the frat heads too and they think it'd be a fun idea for the guys as well.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	433	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_c633e538	li	It's a good way to not only see how your brothers or sisters feel about you, but it also adds that element of individuality. You know what I mean?	game/v11/scene40.rpy	435	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_e476cf7f	no	I know I'm not one to get super excited or anything, but I have to be honest... I really like that idea. I can already think of a few names for some of the girls. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene40.rpy	440	no "[what]"

v11_carriage_ride_6d53959b	no	What do you mean "you don't know"? It's not complicated at all. It's a good way for us to bond with each other, and very easy to implement.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	460	no "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_6aec869c	cl	I mean... I don't know, have the Chicks ever done this sort of thing before?	game/v11/scene40.rpy	465	cl "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_c536d559	li	They have, actually, I guess I should've led with the fact that this wasn't exactly an original idea, but instead a discovered tradition.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	470	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_167fd34a	li	They've been doing this since the beginning of the Chicks, but one year a President didn't give the pledges any nicknames and after a few years of that, the whole thing disappeared.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	472	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_d9ec256f	cl	Well I'm sure there's a good reason the President didn't continue it.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	477	cl "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_6ab37286	no	Yeah, it's called being a lazy President.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	482	no "[what]"

v11_carriage_ride_36d94347	no	I'm not trying, I am. It's a great idea, and the only reason it went away and never got brought back was because of the poor choices of one President.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	492	no "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_25a013c2	cl	Ever thought about the tension a poorly chosen nickname could cause? The bullying that could lead to? I guess you wouldn't care, it's not like you give a fuck about other people's happiness.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	497	cl "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_1657563c	u	I actually think it's really cool, too. I'm sure the benefits would outweigh the negatives. I already have nicknames for some of my frat bros in mind... *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene40.rpy	510	u "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_7851a953	u	Look, the idea sounds good, but I do see the tension it could cause and you guys certainly have enough of that. I think it's best to keep things as is.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	519	u "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_e9fc8e58	no	Yeah sure, but you can't just turn the idea down right away when one of your sisters is coming to you with something that could be really awesome.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	524	no "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_79191ff9	li	Guys, I wasn't trying to start something. I just thought everyone would like it and it'd be something neat for us to talk about.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	529	li "[what]"
v11_carriage_ride_2ad34e9a	no	That's what I first thought when you brought it up, but obviously not everyone is open to new suggestions.	game/v11/scene40.rpy	534	no "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_b24d799a	ro	*Laughs* I apologize, I can't hold it in any longer. Our little actress here is just teasing. Very few Americans sound like... whatever that was exactly. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	45	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_951a4e31	bank	Haha, it was very convincing. So, allow me to say that I've never given a tour of the bank, so this is a very rare occurrence. However, I am very excited to do so.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	50	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f74c49e9	ri	What exactly will we be touring? I kinda just assume your banks are very different from ours.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	55	ri "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_798d2283	bank	Impressive... But, yes, and no. Our banks are very similar, however, our currencies are not.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	70	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_a78f9e3a	bank	You all will have an opportunity to explore our vault today, we'll quiz your current knowledge and so forth.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	71	bank "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_f35221fb	bank	Before I continue, am I mistaken in thinking that there were many more of you?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	81	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_3df324c5	ro	There are, but we were told there was a limit to how many students could be with one guide.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	86	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_101d6427	bank	Ah yes, the others must be in Jerry's group.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	91	bank "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_fb9e107f	bank	I'm sure Jerry just stopped them out front. We have a capacity limit for security purposes.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	107	bank "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_1154faf5	bank	Ahh, I see. Let's begin.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	139	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_c04fa738	u	A little... I'm just not interested in all this kind of stuff I guess.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	144	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_298c8f9c	bank	*Laughs* Neither was I when I was your age. Let's begin.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	149	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_cc50a7af	bank	I wanted to start with what would be the main attraction, our vault. As you can see, our vault looks pretty similar to what you may see in a movie.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	159	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_c75ec0dd	bank	And here's a fun fact for you: Statistics show that less than one percent of people have ever actually seen the inside of a vault in person.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	160	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_59c0d5a0	ry	Make room for us! The top one percent.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	165	ry "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_e49ccfd3	bank	Haha, usually we save that term for the wealthy.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	170	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_d5a695d1	ry	How do you know I'm not wealthy?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	175	ry "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_a8797fd1	ry	Nevermind, just forget I asked.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	185	ry "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_b9ed5b41	bank	Let us continue. May I ask, does anyone know what currency we use?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	190	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_1a8b6c61	no	Euros?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	195	no "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_458b98ae	bank	Ahh, the most common American answer. Due to you being on European trip and Euro sounding so close in name, many Americans assume we use the Euro, when in actuality, we use the Pound.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	200	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_0fc1df83	no	Ahh... Yeah, yeah, yeah. *Chuckles* That's it.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	205	no "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_635588b5	bank	Let me ask another, do you know which is worth more? The US Dollar or the Pound?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	210	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_3c4b7c49	no	Well, right now the pound is.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	215	no "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_815e5ac2	bank	Correct, and I like that you say right now. As I'm sure you all know, currency values can fluctuate.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	220	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_538010f0	am	*Whisper* This shit is boring... I wish we had our go-kart suits right now.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	225	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_6f8b7483	u	*Whisper* Why?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	230	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_3d4d6aa9	am	So we could rob the bank... *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	235	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_dc703301	ri	*Whisper* AMBER!	game/v11/scene43.rpy	240	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_d896d1a6	am	What? It'd be better than taking this stupid tour.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	245	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_58160708	ri	You could at least try to enjoy it.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	250	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_a15f16b7	am	Or I can think of different ways I could rob the place. What do you think, [name]? Are you more of a stealth man or do you enjoy complete chaos?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	255	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_bb864dfc	u	Stealth obviously. You know they have silent security measures all throughout this entire place.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	262	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_a07ee6a4	am	Yes! Stealth is definitely the way to go here.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	267	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_23574379	u	I'm more of a guns blazing, lots of action guy. Go in hard or don't go at all.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	271	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_ad9ef201	am	As fun as it would be to raise hell in a place like this, stealth is the smartest way to go about doing this.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	276	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_5c2d6177	ri	Stop it! No way is a good way. We need to stop talking about this before they think we're actually planning something.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	281	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_c55a7592	am	"We're?" So you're in on it, too?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	286	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f4b0ada9	ri	*Chuckles* No... But if you succeed and get a shit ton of money, I'd be looking for my cut.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	291	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_ba6e323f	u	Haha, what? You gotta help somehow if you want to get a cut.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	296	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_79dcaec8	am	So, how would you help?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	301	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f6ab8d9a	ri	Hmm, I'll distract the tour guide.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	306	ri "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_45b25cb9	am	Yeah, I need to know if what you have in mind will actually work on them.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	316	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_4bb571f6	ri	Excuse me, hi! I was just wondering... Someone said the pound was worth more than our dollars? So if I moved to London would I become rich? What if I get lonely in a new country, all by myself?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	321	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_1c8acf17	am	...	game/v11/scene43.rpy	326	am "[what]"

v11_at_the_bank_fb11d5bd	am	...I was just surprised.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	336	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_ae883642	ri	*Chuckles* That wasn't so hard to do...	game/v11/scene43.rpy	341	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_9e314783	am	We could literally rob this place right now... We don't even have to break in, we're already inside the vault.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	346	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f72aeab6	am	*Chuckles* We could just slide some money in our clothes and act like nothing's happening...	game/v11/scene43.rpy	351	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_14a362bc	u	You're starting to sound like you're actually considering this. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	356	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_4b37f794	am	Maybe I am.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	361	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_c3e1ed25	ri	Don't let her get in your head, [name]. She won't do anything.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	366	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_973c9274	am	But I could. *Chuckles* All I'd have to do is knock out the teller.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	371	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_6aaa6d58	u	*Whisper* Hey, let's be quiet with all this. The tour guide just looked at us.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	376	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_83c2c15a	am	Probably because we're not paying attention to the tour. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	381	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_e5339abb	u	Haha, you're probably right.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	386	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_895e2cc1	am	So, how are we gonna do this? Riley distraction or Amber distraction?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	391	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_e53eb190	ri	We're still talking about this?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	396	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_0ec866a1	am	Better this than listening to the tour.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	401	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_8df31213	u	Let's go with an Amber distraction, we know she won't get nervous or mess anything up. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	408	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_05c5e48a	am	Haha, you got that right. Operation Amber is a go.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	413	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_137b8264	u	We already know Riley's plan works on Amber, so let's go with that. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	419	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_bf89eb02	ri	No, no, no. There is no Riley plan.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	424	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_09f0f6f1	am	Lame. *Laughs* Operation Amber it is, then.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	429	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_dc703301_1	ri	*Whisper* AMBER!	game/v11/scene43.rpy	434	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_44d02129	am	Excuse me miss, earlier you said that pounds are worth more than the dollar. Does that mean that if I moved here and converted my currency I'd be a rich woman?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	439	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_cb9125ef	ri	That... that's my line.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	444	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_08c4374a	bank	*Gasps* I can't believe it.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	449	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_b7032b8d	am	Hey, wait! Ouch!	game/v11/scene43.rpy	454	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_ec72e505	u	Wait, what?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	459	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_153e927c	ro	What's going on?!	game/v11/scene43.rpy	464	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_71d04ea3	bank	You two sit down as well. Immediately.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	474	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_2b674013	u	Okay...	game/v11/scene43.rpy	479	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_b756eefb	ri	Excuse me, but this is a bit unprofessional. Why are we here, and what is going on?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	484	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_23330a5f	bank	I would've never expected you of all people to do such a thing.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	489	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_a1aaa3ec	u	Wait, do what?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	494	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_1c0afcfb	bank	I know the three of you are attempting to rob this bank.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	499	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_0e711b8e	am	So you caught us, now what?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	504	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_9847c493	bank	Now you suffer the consequences.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	509	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_5f8ae4a4	am	They'll never take us in for this. *Chuckles* You have no proof.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	514	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_a44b0e18	bank	There's audio and video recording at all times inside the vault. Not only that, but I overheard everything you said.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	519	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_382d41ab	am	Guess we're going to jail. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	524	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_dd607fa9	u	I guess so, and to think I had such a bright future. Fuck...	game/v11/scene43.rpy	532	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_a2ec0fd2	am	Yeah, about as bright as a rusted quarter. *Laughs* Riley, maybe we'll be cellmates. There's a bright side to all of it.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	537	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_6a319f6b	ri	Yeah, you'll probably have a whole gang or something. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	542	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_0ab268e8	am	You know me so well, haha.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	547	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_491d39c7	bank	Do the three of you not understand the severity of this situation? This is a serious crime.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	552	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_768b02ff	bank	You'll be considered international criminals, meaning your lives are now over. I wouldn't be so-	game/v11/scene43.rpy	553	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_5a3c5abd	am	*Laughs* I'm sorry... I can't hold it in any longer. I can't believe you actually thought we were going to rob a bank in plain daylight.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	558	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_c0ac6f5a	am	*Laughs* We were just bored of your little vault tour and started joking around. You took it way too seriously, ma'am.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	559	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f128364f	bank	Planning to rob a bank is not a joking matter.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	564	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_5b927436	ri	I apologize, but you must realize this isn't at all what we've been looking forward to doing while on vacation in Europe. There's so much more we could be experiencing.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	569	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_28ee73b4	u	I could be sleeping.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	574	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_d3c6e561	bank	I'm not convinced. The line you said to me was the very thing I heard you say you would use to "distract me."	game/v11/scene43.rpy	579	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_b9922a0b	ri	That's because in our "robbing a bank" scenario they wouldn't give me a cut unless I helped with the robbery. I was supposed to play my southern-belle role and ask you the rich person questions.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	584	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_550b4251	u	Alright, as fun as this has been, I think it's starting to get pretty out of hand. I never thought I'd be explaining that I had no real intentions of robbing a bank in London.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	589	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_550b4251_1	u	Alright, as fun as this has been, I think it's starting to get pretty out of hand. I never thought I'd be explaining that I had no real intentions of robbing a bank in London.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	592	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_e322d5be	am	Although if I planned on robbing a bank it would be one in London. The money is worth more compared to ours. *Laughs*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	597	am "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f1fa4139	bank	Haha, wow... Well, at least you all learned something during the tour.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	602	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_d1f60184	ri	See? All fun and games.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	607	ri "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_62bd3a08	bank	*Sighs* I wish I had the fun and youthful spirit you all have. Although, no more jokes about robbing banks, okay?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	612	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_a8ed94bf	ro	Is everything alright?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	617	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_82ea6c9e	bank	You have very imaginative students, but they are free to go. I apologize for cutting the end of the tour short.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	622	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_2315544d	ro	Will someone please explain to me exactly what has happened?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	627	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_9fc581dc	bank	I'd really like to get the rest of the group situated, I shouldn't have left my post. I can get in a lot of trouble for leaving a tour group in the vault, cameras or not. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	633	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f0fc687c	ro	Yes I understand, [name] can fill me in.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	638	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_7d776100	u	It really wasn't anything-	game/v11/scene43.rpy	648	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_6359ae92	ro	Mmm. Excuse me, I couldn't control myself.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	660	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_7350e201	u	(Wow...)	game/v11/scene43.rpy	665	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_f121083b	bank	I'd like to get the rest of the group situated, I shouldn't have left my post. I can get in a lot of trouble for leaving a tour in the vault, cameras or not. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	676	bank "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_1c694d88	ro	Yes. I understand, let's go.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	681	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_7579c14b	lee	How did things go with your group?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	696	lee "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_80a35e6c	ro	Three of them almost got convicted as international criminals for attempted bank robbery.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	701	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_8fd4f91c	lee	*Sighs* I could almost laugh. My students want to walk, how do you plan to get back? Either way we'll make it just in time for the event tonight.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	706	lee "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_8ae46df2	ro	I think we'll take the underground, I personally want to.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	711	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_766d9e54	lee	And I personally wanted to stretch my legs. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene43.rpy	716	lee "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_5ec6202f	ro	*Laughs* Very well, we'll meet back up in the hotel lobby?	game/v11/scene43.rpy	721	ro "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_96a87edb	lee	Sounds like a plan.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	726	lee "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_1e818e1e	lee	Alright students, you have two choices. Students that go back with me will be enjoying a bit sightseeing while we take a nice walk back.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	731	lee "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_4499018f	lee	And the students that choose to go with Ms. Rose will be riding the underground back to the hotel.	game/v11/scene43.rpy	732	lee "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_4da32e52	u	(I'd rather just walk.)	game/v11/scene43.rpy	739	u "[what]"
v11_at_the_bank_7857a323	u	(I'm definitely not walking back.)	game/v11/scene43.rpy	755	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_1f778075	u	Enjoy the bank?	game/v11/scene44.rpy	14	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_7ce2c6d5	no	Not as much as you guys did, apparently. I heard you almost robbed the place. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene44.rpy	19	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_05166ac0	u	Yeah... We weren't actually going to, haha.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	24	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_ea7c245c	no	The way Amber got dragged out of there... You totally could've fooled us.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	29	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_cb344fc0	u	Maybe we should consider acting. Apparently we fooled a lot of people. *Laughs*	game/v11/scene44.rpy	34	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_99d1025b	no	Haha.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	39	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_064fb35b	u	Nora, I wanted to apologize again for what happened at the clock tower.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	45	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_ca223a78	no	It's fine, I understand that I could've given the wrong impression. We're cool.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	50	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_e612bb08	u	Good... good. It's been bothering me quite a bit.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	55	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_ca94292e	no	I could tell something was up.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	60	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_d3a51748	u	Yeah, I'm glad we're good though.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	65	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_fadf797e	no	Yeah.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	70	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_d78d77e9	no	I didn't think things would be as crazy as they've been so far on the trip, but outside of everything that's happened, you've really done your best to make sure I'm having a good time.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	76	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_ea15117e	u	That's what friends are for.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	81	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_cf1c777a	no	Yeah, true. But very few friends actually show it like you do.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	86	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_b24c058e	u	Well, I want to. I want this trip to be something for us to remember. I'm just doing my best to make sure most of the memories are good ones. *Laughs*	game/v11/scene44.rpy	91	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_13e1f270	no	*Chuckles* Thanks, [name]. Really.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	96	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_a16140e3	u	So, I hope it's not weird for me to bring this up, but I saw you talking to Charli at the airport. I wanted to talk to you about what was going on, but I didn't want to interrupt what you guys were talking about.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	101	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_87fd19a4	no	Yeah, he was attempting to cheer me up. Trying a little too hard for someone I just met if you ask me, but I appreciated it regardless.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	106	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_15e7f496	u	I knew I should've said something to you that day.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	111	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_a03761c9	no	You've done enough, [name]. You can't be there for me all the time.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	116	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_26155ed4	u	Haha, guess that's true.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	121	u "[what]"

v11_nora_lingerie_8e36476e	u	Wait, this is Oli's!	game/v11/scene44.rpy	181	u "[what]"

v11_nora_lingerie_229320ef	u	Haha. Well, I already know your bra size thanks to the charity event. *Chuckles*	game/v11/scene44.rpy	256	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_284bd34c	no	Hmph, yeah... I'm sure everyone and their cousin knows by now.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	261	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_34571acc	no	What color do you think would look nicer on me? Pink or white?	game/v11/scene44.rpy	266	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_e8861ceb	u	Hmmm...	game/v11/scene44.rpy	271	u "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_58243550	no	If you're about to make some joke about "having to see it on me first", I may hit you. Fair warning.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	276	no "[what]"
v11_nora_lingerie_75deab01	u	Haha, I wasn't.	game/v11/scene44.rpy	281	u "[what]"

v11_dinner_with_lauren_4435f644	la	At that point I'd had enough. I said a few regrettable things, but I think I got my point across. It's not what I said that I regret, it's just how I said it.	game/v11/scene46.rpy	127	la "[what]"

v12_paris_hotel_fbde4177	no	Hmm... I will admit, it did seem odd to me that you would be talking to Charli.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	158	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_1a458fc8	u	Yeah, very odd. Thanks for introducing me to that guy, by the way.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	163	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_ea0a6525	no	Haha, you're welcome.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	168	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_8569c4fa	u	*Chuckles*	game/v12/scene11.rpy	173	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_30e8b747	no	Sorry for jumping to conclusions. My mind hasn't been all there lately. Charli was just trying to stir shit up I guess.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	178	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_32192906	u	Or trying to cause more issues between you and Chris.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	183	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_c7ad3007	no	There aren't many more issues we could have.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	188	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_09332657	u	What do you mean?	game/v12/scene11.rpy	193	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_cd87c198	no	C'mon.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	203	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_90c09ed5	no	I don't know how to say it, so... I'm just gonna do it.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	213	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_a237f4e1	no	Chris and I have been dating for years now, right? It feels like we've always just been together, to the point that neither of us lived our own lives.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	218	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_52ad94fd	no	And I'm not saying I want to break up with Chris or anything like that...	game/v12/scene11.rpy	219	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_88ff208d	no	I'm just sort of losing confidence in our relationship as it is. I feel we could've done better by getting to know ourselves before we got together.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	227	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_654e3c5d	no	That way we actually knew the person we were getting with instead of figuring that out along the way.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	228	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_7bdc6672	u	Is Chris really not the same person he was when you guys first got together?	game/v12/scene11.rpy	233	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_5fbd7f4b	no	God no, he's changed a lot. He's way more confident, for one. There's been a lot of positive changes, but there's also been... other changes too.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	238	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_de72585c	u	Bad changes?	game/v12/scene11.rpy	243	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_036658ed	no	See, I wouldn't say they're bad, but just not good for me. People can call me what they want, but I like spending a lot of time with my partner, and Chris and I used to spend time together all the time.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	248	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_62309e88	no	So it's not like I'm expecting anything new.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	249	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_d679b51a	no	He basically just stopped giving me the amount of attention that he used to give me. If he acted the way he does now, back then, I'm not saying we wouldn't have dated...	game/v12/scene11.rpy	257	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_9d066fef	no	But I wouldn't be expecting as much as I am from him. I just wish he wouldn't have changed.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	258	no "[what]"

v12_paris_hotel_60bdac76	no	Something like that? But, I'm not just gonna back out you know, I do love him. I've spent most of my life with that man and I have a lot of good memories with him.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	268	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_aad22e55	u	That's very loyal of you. I can only imagine how much you've been through together.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	273	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_182822cf	no	Haha, Chris used to be so corny.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	278	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_c75499d4	u	Ha, really? That's hard to imagine.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	283	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_7fa71476	no	Believe it. I'm telling you, he's changed a lot as we've gotten older. He just...	game/v12/scene11.rpy	288	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_8b4aabeb	u	You okay?	game/v12/scene11.rpy	298	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_49460ea8	no	Yeah, it's just a lot, you know? Never thought I'd be in a situation like this.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	303	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_5c38fef0	u	I'm not going to pick sides or try to sway you one way or the other, I don't feel like that's my place.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	311	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_3a261279	u	I'm friends with both of you so, as your friend, I'm going to support any decision you make. No matter what it is.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	312	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_b9d7650e	no	I really appreciate that. Like for real. Thanks, [name]!	game/v12/scene11.rpy	317	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_d950ac57	u	That's what FRIENDS are for. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene11.rpy	322	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_359de266	u	You know, I'm sure deep down Chris is still the exact same person you fell in love with. He's just in situations now that divide his time up in a way that they didn't before.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	330	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_a9b5c396	u	I bet if all the other distractions weren't a factor, you'd be the only thing on his mind.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	331	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_319183db	no	I'd like to believe that is true.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	336	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_91a0c13b	u	I'm really sure it is.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	341	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_f4ca360f	no	Charli chose the wrong person to try and make me mad at, huh?	game/v12/scene11.rpy	351	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_28fc7c99	u	Definitely.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	356	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_c49a6a8b	no	Should I turn the tables and have a little "mind your own business" talk with him?	game/v12/scene11.rpy	361	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_8d84c8b7	u	You know I'd love to see that.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	369	u "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_cade2afe	no	Haha, I'll think about it.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	374	no "[what]"
v12_paris_hotel_52c18e31	u	Haha, no. Let's just leave it alone. He technically isn't hurting anyone but himself.	game/v12/scene11.rpy	381	u "[what]"

v12_room_chloe_riley_1e845caa	cl	Barely, I was so uncomfortable. Not only that, but I spent the first two hours walking around playing a poor girl... Not very fun by the way if you were wondering. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene12.rpy	28	cl "[what]"
v12_room_chloe_riley_c33647aa	u	Oh, I thought you'd enjoy being poor. *Chuckles* I was actually the one that suggested it to Mr. Lee.	game/v12/scene12.rpy	33	u "[what]"

v12_riley_cafe_de81bc76	u	*Laughs* That's not even funny, it is not like that.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	233	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_18b7e1cb	ri	*Laughs* Believe it or not, it's from a movie. One of my favorite actors who, now that I think about it, is actually from France.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	238	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_03a0a402	ri	He traveled to America in the movie for an undercover mission and had never been to America before that.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	239	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_457bdf91	ri	He'd only watched old cowboy movies and thought all Americans talked like that. I was super young when I watched it and since then, I always mock that voice for fun.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	244	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_e71f8ff6	u	Well, you've got it down pretty damn well. I'm not surprised that so many people believe it's your real voice.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	249	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_eb43f91b	ri	Would you, if you didn't know?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	254	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_d1a78d77	u	I think I'd be able to tell.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	265	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_78794933	ri	Then I guess I need to find more victims to practice on...	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	270	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_bdd6d55d	u	*Laughs* You're a fucking creep.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	275	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_dd6658e6	ri	Hehe...	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	280	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_a9594d2f	u	I don't think I'd be able to tell, actually.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	286	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_f1610adc	ri	Then I must have perfected my work.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	291	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_fcc18885	u	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	296	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_ed29ae5c	u	So... What do you have planned for today?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	301	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_d3628402	ri	You mean what do we have planned today?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	306	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_8b258704	u	Huh?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	311	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_6ffd983e	ri	We're going to complete "treasure hunt: part two" today. As a matter of fact, we can get it out of the way right after we finish eating.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	316	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_8a8ba43f	u	Almost forgot about that... Yeah, that's definitely the move.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	324	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_330d4286	u	Oh yayyy, another boring treasure hunt.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	329	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_0d6ffd39	u	Ha... Ah, man. So, where's this one anyway?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	334	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_557996ef	ri	I'll tell you when we get there.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	339	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_ecbe9197	u	Riley... At least tell me what the clue was.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	344	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_4cb60ee1	ri	Nope. I wanna see if my guess is right. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	349	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_5b647d59	u	*Sighs* Alright, well... As easy as the first one was, I'm expecting this one to be close by?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	354	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_304a39d3	ri	Guess we'll find out when we get there... *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	359	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_58bd1c3f	fwait	Okay, here you go.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	369	fwait "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_2e27d283	ri	That was fast!	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	374	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_0564368c	fwait	Mademoiselle, your accent?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	379	fwait "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_efb27d36	u	Cover officially blown. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	384	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_08795ece	ri	Haha, I'm sorry, I was just playing around before.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	389	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_5bd6d242	fwait	Oh, I see, it wasn't very funny...	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	394	fwait "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_1e6db622	ri	Huh!?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	399	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_3fbab108	fwait	Your accent. It wasn't very funny, and you meant it as a joke, right?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	404	fwait "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_145900dc	ri	Well yes, but I was going for you being convinced that I actually spoke like that. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	409	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_ff908bcf	fwait	Oh, well... I'd like to keep you from embarrassing yourself even more while you're here in Paris. It wasn't good at all. Also, if I may say... It was pretty rude as well.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	414	fwait "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_1e28e083	ri	I... I'm so s-	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	419	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_1e45bca8	fwait	*Laughs* Now who's making the jokes? *Chuckles* Your accent was very convincing.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	424	fwait "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_fcc18885_1	u	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	429	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_012b4e98	ri	Oh my gosh! *Chuckles* I seriously just panicked for a second. I thought you were actually pissed and that people had just been lying to me all this time. *Laughs* Holy shit...	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	434	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_4683c6d3	u	That was fucking hilarious.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	439	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_7ed58126	fwait	Haha, you two enjoy your food.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	444	fwait "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_0ab328e1	u	Damn... She got you good. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	454	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_c01be45d	ri	Not gonna lie, she really did. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	459	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_1b47ef9a	ri	Feel better?	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	484	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_29d7eae7	u	A lot better!	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	489	u "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_ce0fbc71	ri	Let's hurry up and get on the hunt.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	494	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_cafe_e7a41f39	u	Lead the way.	game/v12/scene14a.rpy	499	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_3435cfe5	u	Where the fuck are we?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	17	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_80674681	ri	The catacombs. *Chuckles* This is the spot of the next clue.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	22	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_bf7b92d3	u	I really doubt that, but... Then again, I don't know the riddle.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	27	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_0bc325f7	ri	Don't doubt my skills, [name]. But if you must know, listen. "In the city of love, where sleeping hearts lie, not down in the river but where the ancestors lie."	game/v12/scene15.rpy	32	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_f299b2c1	u	So, why here? "Where ancestors lie" could be any cemetery. Hell, it could be a pyramid or a museum.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	37	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_1c0b4ca5	ri	First of all, there are no pyramids in Paris. Second, I saw a picture of the catacombs at Duncan's. And third, there's nothing special about a regular cemetery.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	42	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_3f93b678	u	Riley! Don't say things like that, especially about a burial ground. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene15.rpy	47	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_e3145d74	ri	What? I didn't mean it in a bad way... I'm just saying in regard to the treasure hunt, it's more likely to be here.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	52	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_ba6ee298	u	Hating on the dead is never a good thing. When the zombies, ghosts or whatever comes, I won't be there to help you. But at least you'll have your super power and you can tell them if they're hungry. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene15.rpy	57	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_87a5867b	ri	Oh my gosh, c'mon already.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	62	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_0ab2dec4	u	This is confusing, how are we supposed to know where to go or what to do?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	75	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_dea5ef22	ri	Don't be a party pooper, just follow me.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	80	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_08cc1b17	ri	I'm pretty sure this is where the bodies are put.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	95	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_f70aa024	u	I feel like we're not supposed to be down here.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	100	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_fe8721fd	ri	Maybe we are, maybe we aren't. Start looking around for the next clue... I'm positive it's here somewhere.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	105	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_5a6e5b0e	u	Did you find anything?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	121	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_8e14523e	ri	Not yet, you?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	126	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_131d39a7	u	Nope, still looking. I'm telling you Riley, there's nothing down h-	game/v12/scene15.rpy	131	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_57ae9944	u	*Sighs*	game/v12/scene15.rpy	143	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_7ffe103c	ri	Why are you sitting?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	148	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_1a07e571	u	I give up, I can't find it. I'm telling you there's nothing down here.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	153	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_7b6333da	ri	C'mon, please? I can't find it myself.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	158	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_edef53e6	u	Oh, I'm sure you can.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	163	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_0954abe9	ri	[name]...	game/v12/scene15.rpy	168	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_c2fdeef5	ri	Oh, wait! I just found something.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	178	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_9a9c20f2	u	I stand corrected... *Chuckles* What is it?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	188	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_bc83ef33	ri	This has to be the clue.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	198	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_f9c5a9d6	u	Pull it out.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	203	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_ab6ddc47	ri	...	game/v12/scene15.rpy	208	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_ef2f1671	u	What?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	213	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_128ad64b	ri	I'm kind of nervous.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	218	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_520dc18d	u	Why? It's just a piece of paper. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene15.rpy	223	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_dffc0a65	ri	All we had to do was look around for it... This almost feels too easy.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	228	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_47381314	u	*Sighs* Fine. I'll do it.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	233	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_1e8a12f4	u	See, nothing went wrong.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	243	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_62bb2ea4	ri	You're not suspicious or anything?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	253	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_747de4d3	u	Why? Should I be?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	258	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_cdac905d	ri	Well, you know-	game/v12/scene15.rpy	263	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_93b929f3	u	What the fuck?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	268	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_211a92f2	ri	And... Now we're in the dark.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	273	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_8e07fad3	u	*Sighs* I'm starting to really hate these shitty riddles.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	278	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_2057c186	ri	*Chuckles*	game/v12/scene15.rpy	283	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_830e231b	ri	Oh nice, we're good I guess. Let's get back and...	game/v12/scene15.rpy	288	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_af2d87b2	u	And... what?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	293	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_b59b03ab	ri	I actually don't know how to get back, do you?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	298	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_9d4a54f6	u	I was just following you.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	303	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_749dc388	ri	Okay, what is going on?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	308	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_ee7ea283	u	I have no fucking clue...	game/v12/scene15.rpy	313	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_f7edf692	ri	Let's get the fuck out of here, now. Please hold my hand so we don't get lost.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	328	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_61bf0970	ri	You pick! Which way should we go?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	333	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_69831fa0	u	Pretty sure it's this way.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	340	u "[what]"

v12_riddle_riley_0a344163	ri	Not exactly. I think I fucked up my ankle...	game/v12/scene15.rpy	410	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_47602cd5	u	Can you walk?	game/v12/scene15.rpy	415	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_55ddc3a2	ri	Not comfortably... I'm sorry.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	420	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_265e5e75	u	It's fine, c'mon.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	438	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_0aacf53a	ri	Thanks. It's probably not that bad. *Chuckles* It'll likely be fine in a few minutes, it surprised me more than it hurt.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	443	ri "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_baa4d711	u	Don't worry, I got you. But, everything that's happened so far has just given me more of a reason to not like this stupid hunt.	game/v12/scene15.rpy	448	u "[what]"
v12_riddle_riley_c039f50a	ri	We are running into every problem possible aren't we? *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene15.rpy	453	ri "[what]"

v12_valentine_167da8d3	lee	Riley, did something hold you two back? I thought you'd be returning sooner.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	33	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_98e7a193	ri	Sorry, we were doing the second riddle.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	38	ri "[what]"
v12_valentine_2615c92f	lee	Oh, no need to apologize for that. I'm happy to see you guys being so productive with the hunt!	game/v12/scene16.rpy	43	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_29c8ace7	ri	Of course. By the way, I hate to miss out on the next activity but I twisted my ankle a bit while we were hunting, and I was hoping to rest it off a little...	game/v12/scene16.rpy	48	ri "[what]"
v12_valentine_f4cdac5e	lee	Of course, yes! Ms. Rose will be staying here at the hotel so if you need anyone at all, you go to her.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	53	lee "[what]"

v12_valentine_4536cc56	lee	Well... As I said, we're learning about love today. How could you go to the City of Love without doing so?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	88	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_031d3a4f	lee	There's a church nearby and the bishop has been gracious enough to teach you students the story of Valentine. I could teach you myself, but I'm sure this will be a much more enjoyable experience.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	93	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_d5702d98	li	This is kind of exciting... *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene16.rpy	98	li "[what]"
v12_valentine_814f5f68	lee	Indeed it is. As a matter of fact, the church we're going to was St. Valentine's primary church when he left Italy. Cool, right?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	103	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_694d3790	lee	So, if everyone's ready. You guys know the drill, shuttles are outside.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	108	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_32430448	lee	Everyone please be on your best behavior, I am reminding you that this is a church.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	133	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_f1e6538b	imre	Ha, right. No promises.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	138	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_f3532f3c	imre	I'm just kidding... Sheesh.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	148	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_1b4dc306	bishop	Mr. Lee! These must be your students, it's wonderful to meet you all. Has your teacher informed you of what you'll be learning today?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	161	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_d128ff40	no	He did.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	166	no "[what]"
v12_valentine_34c9f91f	bishop	Very good. Please follow me and take a seat up here at the front.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	171	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_ff1162ea	bishop	First, I'll introduce myself. My name is Bishop Jenkins. I've been a member of this church for about thirty years now and I've had the pleasure of telling the story of Valentine for decades.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	181	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_8bb0be8a	bishop	Are any of you familiar with the story?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	182	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_4dd7f8a2	no	I'm familiar with the holiday. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene16.rpy	187	no "[what]"
v12_valentine_0660ab18	li	*Laughs* Yeah, that's about it for me as well.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	192	li "[what]"
v12_valentine_5789e68e	bishop	*Chuckles* That's usually the case for most students. Due to most holidays stemming from religious roots, it's rare for schools to actually teach students the meaning behind Valentine's.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	197	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_ad35984f	bishop	But today I'll be doing just that. Have any of you heard of St. Valentine?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	198	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_5e4d268b	imre	That's the flying baby with the bow and arrow that shoots people, right?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	203	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_e612e93e	lee	Imre, behave yourself. This is no time for jokes.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	208	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_9163eec0	imre	I wasn't trying to be funny...	game/v12/scene16.rpy	213	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_3bb72112	bishop	There are no silly questions, no bad guesses. We welcome all, Mr. Lee.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	218	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_321e9c39	bishop	To you young man, who you're thinking of is the fictional character named Cupid commonly associated with Valentine's day due to being the Roman god of love.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	223	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_529dc31e	lee	Greek.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	228	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_958140d1	bishop	I'm sorry?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	233	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_54622c97	lee	The Greek God of love.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	238	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_5862b772	bishop	Another common mistake. Cupid is the Roman God of Love and within Greek mythology, he is the son of Aphrodite who is the God of Love in Greek mythology.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	243	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_c03cad3d	u	*Whisper* I'm sensing some tension between Mr. Lee and Jenkins.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	248	u "[what]"
v12_valentine_2f438ce7	li	*Whisper* Yeah, me too.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	253	li "[what]"
v12_valentine_41c83b3a	bishop	Two thousand years ago, the Romans had the world's strongest army. They were so strong, they conquered nearly all of Europe, parts of Asia and Africa.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	258	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_b9753934	charli	Around the time Jesus was killed?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	263	charli "[what]"
v12_valentine_d6319c29	bishop	Correct. After some time, they began to grow very rich and with that wealth came laziness. Life in the army was harsh, so many soldiers longed for the comfort of home... And most importantly, marriage.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	268	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_6fddbaa8	li	Awww.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	273	li "[what]"
v12_valentine_67aa57bd	bishop	Sadly, the Emperor at the time grew worried that his army was growing weak and decided to ban soldiers from getting married.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	278	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_97cc7a0f	no	WAIT, WHAT?!	game/v12/scene16.rpy	283	no "[what]"
v12_valentine_e5d91b00	li	How could he do that? Was there not some type of congress or anything?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	288	li "[what]"
v12_valentine_57e3ab9f	bishop	Times weren't as they are today and dictators ruled the world in the form of Kings, Emperors and false gods.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	293	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_8bfaae1f	li	That's not fair.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	298	li "[what]"
v12_valentine_74a83191	imre	And it's probably why Rome doesn't exist anymore.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	303	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_c8482af8	ch	Rome still exists. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene16.rpy	308	ch "[what]"
v12_valentine_3babc258	imre	No it doesn't.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	313	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_97c9a42f	ch	It's the capital of Italy...	game/v12/scene16.rpy	318	ch "[what]"
v12_valentine_9d77f0cf	imre	I meant the Empire doesn't exist.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	323	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_34ec8c3e	ch	Oh... *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene16.rpy	328	ch "[what]"
v12_valentine_c0735ef3	imre	Jeez guys, I'm not stupid.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	333	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_441ba8b1	bishop	Ahh, to be young. So, during that time many Romans were Christians and there was a Bishop leader by the name of Bishop Valentine.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	338	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_468786d4	no	You hold the same position that Valentine had.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	343	no "[what]"
v12_valentine_bcd5268b	bishop	Exactly. And like Valentine, I too believe that if a man and a woman love each other, they should both get married.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	348	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_b5d3929d	bishop	Valentine went against the Emperor's law and allowed soldiers to get married at his church in secret.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	349	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_2b3498d7	lee	I'm pretty sure he actually did the ceremonies during the night, deep within the forest to not avoid suspicion.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	354	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_f9c8cee0	bishop	And, do you have a source for that information?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	359	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_bdc9bce2	lee	I wanted to be just as informed on the topic as you, so I did a barrage of research during my time here in Europe.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	364	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_40786f70	bishop	No disrespect intended, but I doubt your days of research can make up for decades of studying ancient text.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	369	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_5743bfa4	lee	I-	game/v12/scene16.rpy	374	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_3d96698a	bishop	Anyway... Eventually word got out and the Emperor not only demanded Valentine to stop his secret weddings, but also wanted him to convert to the Roman faith.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	379	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_a165df77	bishop	When Valentine refused, he was sentenced to death.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	380	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_31d229ba	imre	Bro... What kind of story is this? Where is the love?	game/v12/scene16.rpy	385	imre "[what]"
v12_valentine_ec88fbba	bishop	Bear with me, my son.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	390	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_5cf1e8c4	bishop	While in prison, prior to his execution, the jailer's blind daughter would bring him his meals and from that stemmed many conversations. From those many conversations, they fell in love.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	391	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_9e07f9ef	bishop	One day, Saint Valentine slid his hand through the bars of his cell, touched the lids of the girl's eyes and miraculously she could see.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	392	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_41920796	charli	*Whisper* Good god, this is nonsense.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	397	charli "[what]"
v12_valentine_e8be0fea	li	*Whisper* Charli, stop it.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	402	li "[what]"
v12_valentine_64b36ec2	bishop	Valentine's execution was set for the 14th of February, and on his last day he wrote his beloved a letter and signed it, "from your Valentine."	game/v12/scene16.rpy	407	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_025ea3b9	no	That is so sweet but so sad.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	412	no "[what]"
v12_valentine_4c46d298	bishop	Valentine's beloved received the letter and before the execution she pleaded with her father, the jailer, to help Valentine escape.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	417	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_564dc7c3	bishop	Her father did just that, and Valentine came to what is now modern day Paris.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	418	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_095ca792	lee	He did not escape, he was executed. That's what makes the story a tragedy. None of the known research mentions that he escaped.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	423	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_a95776f1	bishop	Clarification, none of your known research.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	428	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_f12d9273	lee	I'd like to see what artifacts prove his escape.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	433	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_51ee55db	bishop	Mr. Lee, we are all professionals at what we've dedicated our lives toward.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	438	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_a1208f92	bishop	Your knowledge of history in a general sense is something I'd never attempt to challenge. I'd appreciate the same respect for my specialization.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	439	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_c8fff498	lee	I just don't want my students being taught false information.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	444	lee "[what]"

v12_valentine_72f4a585	bishop	To carry on, students, Valentine dedicated his life to ensuring that others could live a life with love and in the end, it was love that saved him.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	479	bishop "[what]"

v12_valentine_ed8a3f83	u	Oh, yeah. Sure.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	568	u "[what]"
v12_valentine_ae25db16	bishop	Now, there is a set of default vows designed by the church, but participants are always welcome to say their own vows.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	583	bishop "[what]"
v12_valentine_4c1aca09	lee	I'd like to see some originality, so the students should do their own.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	588	lee "[what]"
v12_valentine_8f30ee4d	bishop	So be it. We've already rushed the procedures of the ceremony quite a bit, but I'm betting most of you have seen a wedding so I'll assume you get the gist.	game/v12/scene16.rpy	593	bishop "[what]"

v12_escape_room_36e0ad5c	charli	Let's try to be logical about this. It says that it can hear us and asked us to say hello, so let's start with that.	game/v12/scene17.rpy	365	charli "[what]"

v12_escape_room_c0a7c3bd	imre	It's all voice activated, I think. There's a first message to begin, but after that it just sends the next message or does the next thing based on what we say and when we say it.	game/v12/scene17.rpy	397	imre "[what]"

v12_escape_room_39ae1d8a	charli	I wonder if she responds directly to us or if she has a prepared response. Like if I said, "just so you know, my name is Charli", would she know my name is Charli?	game/v12/scene17.rpy	417	charli "[what]"
v12_escape_room_4f52adba	li	Let's see, I just got another message.	game/v12/scene17.rpy	423	li "[what]"

v12_escape_room_1450d46b	li	Sorry I read that last part. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene17.rpy	433	li "[what]"
v12_escape_room_113fa046	charli	Well, that proves that they respond directly to us rather than automated responses. I assume it's the guy at the front.	game/v12/scene17.rpy	438	charli "[what]"
v12_escape_room_7974e7fe	li	New message, "One at a time... and stop making silly guesses."	game/v12/scene17.rpy	444	li "[what]"

v12_nursing_aubrey_18422fbc	au	How come you decided to walk all the way back with me instead of having drinks with Nora? We both know she's a full fucking snack... *Laughs*	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	133	au "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_e8d40900	u	Ha... What does that have to do with it?	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	138	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_f7b18183	au	I just thought you normally chase after the prettiest girl, haha.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	143	au "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_d65fbcc9	u	Maybe I do, but in this situation that'd make you the prettiest girl.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	148	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_cc93d494	au	You only came back with me 'cause you were hoping you'd get some. You don't have to lie.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	153	au "[what]"

v12_nursing_aubrey_a2668c7a	au	Because guys don't do that, and girls don't either really. People always want something in return and sex is usually nice for both sides.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	173	au "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_4f29cc78	u	Not everything is about sex, sometimes you just help people.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	178	u "[what]"

v12_nursing_aubrey_c3dcba99	au	Well, "maybe" I'll think about it.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	211	au "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_8569c4fa	u	*Chuckles*	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	216	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_ea15117e	u	That's what friends are for.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	222	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_fd4218e7	au	Hmm... I don't think all friends would be willing to massage someone's feet.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	227	au "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_23ca0c37	u	Well, then I'm the foot massaging kind of friend. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	232	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_459ee61d	au	*Chuckles* Fucking weirdo...	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	237	au "[what]"

v12_nursing_aubrey_ebd3bfc4	imre	Huh?! What's wrong with me?	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	263	imre "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_1f2ba661	u	He looks like he drank a little too much, but that's nothing new...	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	268	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_e0c7c8b3	no	Him being drunk isn't the problem, it's what he did while drunk.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	273	no "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_d431df34	u	Yikes, Imre... What'd you do this time? *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	278	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_606bf365	no	I took my shirt off to sunbathe for a bit in my bra and he started inviting people over, selling tickets to watch me... Claiming they were paying to see a "beautiful foreign girl sunbathe".	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	283	no "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_dbc725ed	imre	I fail to see the lie... I'm an honest entrepreneur.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	288	imre "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_fcc18885	u	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	293	u "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_20577f77	no	Yeah, you see my point?	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	298	no "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_8d7e6ba7	no	*Chuckles* What about you guys? How's your foot, Aubrey?	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	303	no "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_54856801	au	A lot better. [name] massaged out the pain for a while actually.	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	308	au "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_d318fc07	no	Ooo, a foot massage sounds sooooo nice. Maybe I should fall and get hurt too. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	313	no "[what]"
v12_nursing_aubrey_38bbe564	imre	I just got an idea! How about we sell tickets to massage "a beautiful foreigner's feet"? Genius, dude!	game/v12/scene21a.rpy	318	imre "[what]"

v12_riley_room_e860c5b2	ri	I was coming to get Aubrey's help, but I overheard her say that her ankle was hurt. The walls are really thin in this hotel...	game/v12/scene22.rpy	20	ri "[what]"
v12_riley_room_f737a837	u	*Chuckles* Yeah, I can help you.	game/v12/scene22.rpy	25	u "[what]"

v12_riley_room_413b78ba	ri	Probably because this wasn't his first time drinking like that.	game/v12/scene22.rpy	75	ri "[what]"

v12_riley_room_ab478a5a	u	That's good to hear. Whenever I see you two together you're always smiling.	game/v12/scene22.rpy	120	u "[what]"
v12_riley_room_7f996817	u	You know, if I didn't know any better I'd think you were one of the Chicks.	game/v12/scene22.rpy	125	u "[what]"

v12_penelope_roof_c88e45f6	u	Hasn't the world always been like that?	game/v12/scene3.rpy	213	u "[what]"
v12_penelope_roof_414abb92	pe	Maybe, you're right. Either way though, I can't stand it. It's like people don't take their victims into consideration.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	218	pe "[what]"
v12_penelope_roof_943672cd	pe	Sure, I may have done some bad things before, but I could never do something bad that resulted in someone being a victim.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	223	pe "[what]"

v12_penelope_roof_5ecc5ec7	u	Exactly, it's not an option. So rather than focusing on the bad people we just have to do our best to be a good person, and like you said, try to enjoy our lives.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	248	u "[what]"
v12_penelope_roof_970c1436	pe	Mr. Lee tell you that?	game/v12/scene3.rpy	253	pe "[what]"

v12_penelope_roof_5baebef1	pe	Along with all the chores he gives me, he makes sure he has time to dive into deep philosophical conversations. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene3.rpy	263	pe "[what]"
v12_penelope_roof_bd919c9c	u	*Mocking tone* "The past is in the past, so leave it there. But right now is a gift, that's why it's called the present." How was that? *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene3.rpy	268	u "[what]"

v12_penelope_roof_93424824	pe	I think you struggle with right and wrong just like everyone does, but that doesn't mean you're good or bad. It means you're human.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	295	pe "[what]"
v12_penelope_roof_c733c8e3	pe	With you, it's like watching someone try to pick up everyone's fallen pieces and helping them solve their own puzzles. Selfless, caring, and loyal... To me, you're a good guy.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	301	pe "[what]"
v12_penelope_roof_166be7a9	u	Thanks Penelope, that means a lot to me.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	306	u "[what]"

v12_penelope_roof_78101a7e	pe	*Laughs* Yeah, you've got a few other things to figure out before you start thinking about tying the knot.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	338	pe "[what]"
v12_penelope_roof_2fb7551a	u	I'm a guy like me.	game/v12/scene3.rpy	347	u "[what]"

v12_docks_cd6dedba	u	Suspiciously giggly if you ask me.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	82	u "[what]"
v12_docks_1881ad1a	ri	Speaking of asking you things, and please just keep this between me and you, but I saw you walking with Amber. Did she say anything about me?	game/v12/scene6.rpy	87	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_f8ca0db8	u	Not much, we didn't really talk. What's going on?	game/v12/scene6.rpy	98	u "[what]"
v12_docks_a90a728f	u	No, what's going on?	game/v12/scene6.rpy	105	u "[what]"
v12_docks_d5f34c65	ri	Well, I said something and I don't know how she took it.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	110	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_40af8f52	u	What'd you say?	game/v12/scene6.rpy	115	u "[what]"
v12_docks_f3b2da55	ri	I kinda told her I liked her, liked her.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	120	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_40394d37	u	Oh. And she said...?	game/v12/scene6.rpy	125	u "[what]"
v12_docks_ec5e488d	ri	Well, that's the thing. She didn't say anything. She kinda just brushed it off and left real fast.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	130	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_fdbce207	u	Oh...	game/v12/scene6.rpy	135	u "[what]"
v12_docks_26a4d4d0	ri	I just wanted to know if she said anything, I'm not gonna let it bother me though.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	140	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_f74a8644	ri	Aubrey and I talked about this little slumber party idea I had and she's been keeping me company.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	145	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_59556379	u	Well, that's good. You and Aubrey were already really close I thought.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	150	u "[what]"
v12_docks_d812ab51	ri	We are, I'd just been spending a lot of time with Amber and blowing off pretty much everyone else.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	155	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_430bbf0d	u	Ohh, haha.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	160	u "[what]"
v12_docks_686a74bd	ri	Well, thanks. And don't pretend like you don't enjoy doing the treasure hunt... You know you like spending time with me.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	165	ri "[what]"
v12_docks_006e880d	u	Haha. Yeah, you're right. I do.	game/v12/scene6.rpy	170	u "[what]"
v12_docks_f2f0d67a	u	(Hmmm, this must be what Amber was saying she wanted to talk about. I knew them two were getting close, but not like this.)	game/v12/scene6.rpy	175	u "[what]"
v12s7_free_roam_spoken_c7964da2	u	(I've already spoken to them, but I could still murder them)	game/v12/scene7.rpy	7	u "[what]"
v12s7fr_99e1200b	lee	Students, please gather around. I have something very exciting to announce.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	26	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_d149b9a8	lee	First of all, it's been brought to my attention that many of you were unaware that we'd be taking the ferry rather than flying.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	38	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_995bf04a	lee	This was a last-minute adjustment, so I do apologize. Although, I think this voyage will be well worth it.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	39	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_37ba52ec	ca	It's costing me a lot of money to look out for you, ya know?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	45	ca "[what]"
v12s7fr_9e593508	sa	Then go home.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	50	sa "[what]"
v12s7fr_5033d044	lee	As you all know, I take great pride in seizing every opportunity I can to teach my students and this ferry ride will be no different.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	55	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_849ebf66	lee	Decades ago, a famous murder was committed on this ferry. A murder that we will, in a way, be re-enacting.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	56	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_4b880798	ri	Wait, will we be playing characters?!	game/v12/scene7.rpy	61	ri "[what]"
v12s7fr_f0975ca0	au	I hope so. Murder and roleplay? I'm getting a little too excited... *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	66	au "[what]"
v12s7fr_e9e0a07a	ri	*Laughs* I hope you don't have to play a virgin nun.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	71	ri "[what]"
v12s7fr_a1e3dff0	lee	Each student will be given a role to play because we will be re-enacting this murder by playing a murder mystery.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	76	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_9a3afaed	u	(Well, would you look at that. Looks like I'm going to be getting some blood on these hands.)	game/v12/scene7.rpy	91	u "[what]"
v12s7fr_4686d0f1	lee	On each card there is a detailed description of the character you'll be playing. As well as a marker saying whether or not you are the murderer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	96	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_856b12e5	imre	Can we please just choose our characters instead?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	101	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_3d14843e	lee	You can not. I purposefully chose the roles you are each being given.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	106	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_b77c3de9	lee	As I said, one of you is the murderer and it's the murderer's job to kill as many students as they can without being caught. Once the murderer is discovered, the game is over.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	107	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_90519592	imre	Wait, really?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	112	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_5bf9f6dc	lee	Yes.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	117	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_e7d8c33d	imre	YEAHHH BOY!	game/v12/scene7.rpy	122	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_fe8b62d2	lee	*Sighs* Why does that excite you, Imre?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	127	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_26a92914	imre	Because, I'll just find out who the murderer is and force them to fess up and then boom, game over and I can sleep the rest of the boat ride. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	132	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_84688c90	lee	That's not possible.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	137	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_01013027	imre	How is it not? It doesn't break any rules.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	142	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_a5e83c73	lee	As a matter of fact, it does. Students will be FORBIDDEN from breaking character until the murderer has been identified.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	147	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_326cede8	imre	And what happens if we do?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	152	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_75c9eb73	lee	Do you know how to swim, Imre?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	157	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_5d1ceeff	imre	Yeah...?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	162	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_6e8b0b75	lee	Good. Because after you choose to break character, you'll be swimming to Paris.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	167	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_93ff3184	imre	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	172	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_65760518	imre	Oh, you're not joking.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	177	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_aa201a5d	am	What if the killer never gets caught? *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	182	am "[what]"
v12s7fr_b77481c0	lee	That would be very, very impressive and also requires the murderer to be a great listener, someone who is very perceptive, and also a person who can smooth through conversations easily.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	187	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_12929590	lee	Those three are key.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	192	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_25350ad7	au	Okay, so... Do we get anything for doing this? Besides it being fun and something to keep us busy... *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	197	au "[what]"
v12s7fr_1c416d43	lee	Based on how well the murderer does, and how many kills they achieve... I might be able to think of some type of reward. But, it must wait until Amsterdam to take place as our Paris schedule is already very full.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	202	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_2f32c9ce	ry	*Scoffs* So if we aren't the murderer, our only goal is to not get killed? And we don't get rewarded for it?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	207	ry "[what]"
v12s7fr_95a807aa	lee	I know this sounds... Unfair. All in all, the mass murder we will be reenacting today was not fair to the victims.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	212	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_f4a93cf0	lee	Your goal is to make sure the murderer does not get a reward, by catching them as soon as possible.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	213	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_392b4bb8	lee	Now, If the murderer does get a reward... I suppose the "prize" could be something catered for two. So the murderer will have to share it with one of his or her victims... Fair?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	214	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_e3b7af83	ry	I mean... I guess?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	219	ry "[what]"
v12s7fr_0b5cc114	lee	Let me emphasize that again, DO NOT BREAK CHARACTER. If you think you're safe from prying eyes and free to do whatever you please, you're not.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	224	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_e28aa67a	lee	You must assume that I'm always there watching, because I will be. If you have something to say, you must say it in character.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	225	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_5cc8099a	ri	*Southern Accent* Once again, the wealthy are being brought down by the ways of the lazy.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	230	ri "[what]"
v12s7fr_fcddbb1b	lee	And that's why she's my favorite student! Already playing her rich woman role.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	235	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_2f0ff11a	imre	BRO WHAT?! YOU MADE ME SOMEONE'S WIFE?!?!	game/v12/scene7.rpy	240	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_30910191	charli	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	245	charli "[what]"
v12s7fr_636a0944	ry	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	250	ry "[what]"
v12s7fr_7312d2da	lee	I wouldn't be so quick to laugh, Ryan. You're playing his spouse.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	255	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_2a35555b	ry	WAIT, WHAT?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	260	ry "[what]"
v12s7fr_acc49ca1	charli	*Laughs* Welcome to the club "rainbow unicorn".	game/v12/scene7.rpy	265	charli "[what]"
v12s7fr_ae3df182	imre	I don't care if I have to act like a girl or not, I'll still beat your ass Charli.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	270	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_eeb14895	lee	That won't be possible either. Students, please understand something. I, as your teacher, see and observe everything. Your personalities, your interactions with each other, etc.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	275	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_919601c5	lee	The roles I've chosen for you are intended to help you or for my own personal enjoyment. Charli will be playing the role of the Captain.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	276	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_38a207f8	charli	Ooh, I like the sound of that. A position of authority.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	281	charli "[what]"
v12s7fr_58539459	lee	And with power comes great responsibility. So, you will be limited to the Captain's Quarters at all times.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	286	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_f6bacf12	charli	I'm not able to walk around the ship?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	291	charli "[what]"
v12s7fr_b8df84f7	lee	You are not.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	296	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_69655a8a	charli	*Scoffs* Then how could I possibly catch the murderer?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	301	charli "[what]"
v12s7fr_8643a3fb	lee	You'll have to depend on your security, Amber. You'll also be able to make announcements over the PA.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	306	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_a2a15790	charli	Hmm, I guess that'll do.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	311	charli "[what]"
v12s7fr_db2aca54	am	Ahh yeah, I'm so ready to play into this. I'm not holding back either. This was probably the worst role I could've been given.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	316	am "[what]"
v12s7fr_dddae891	lee	Or the best.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	321	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_fd926aac	cl	So how do we know who the murderer is? Like, how will they "kill" people?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	326	cl "[what]"
v12s7fr_4c377cb7	lee	The murderer will kill people by pointing at them with a fake finger gun. If you get killed then quietly make your way to the dining hallway. Do not give any hints to any of the players that haven't been killed.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	331	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_ffea3c8c	imre	Wait, so-	game/v12/scene7.rpy	336	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_e8905f97	lee	Using any sort of loophole as a way to sabotage the game will result in you getting thrown overboard.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	341	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_75bbf242	imre	*Chuckles* You can't actually throw us overboard.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	346	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_b41a0021	lee	Oh? I'm pretty sure your school waiver says I can do anything with the intention of education as long as it doesn't harm the students. And you'll definitely be learning a lesson as you struggle your way to Paris.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	351	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_f2a7d0fd	imre	Okay, fine. I won't mess up your stupid game.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	356	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_a4a9a024	lee	Very good. Again everyone, the only way the murderer gets caught is by someone witnessing the crime. Does anyone have any questions?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	361	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_ced09284	imre	Umm, is it okay if I just don't play at all?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	366	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_f2405098	lee	Do you have a reason for skipping the activity other than just not wanting to?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	371	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_9f8d5c57	imre	...	game/v12/scene7.rpy	376	imre "[what]"
v12s7fr_a559506c	lee	I'm not giving you time to think of one, Imre.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	381	lee "[what]"
v12s7fr_510064b8	lee	Everyone will be participating. If that's all then please, grab some props that fit your role and enjoy the murder mystery.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	383	lee "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_55a53705	au	Hey there, handsome. Please make sure you're being careful, okay? I'd hate for you to get hurt, but if you do find yourself needing some love and care, don't forget to come see your favorite nurse. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	427	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_6acc44aa	u	Well, my travelling nurse may get a little jealous.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	435	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_52de15a7	u	As a world-famous boxer I'm always getting bumps and bruises so I have to travel with a nurse, but I wanted a little break from everyone so she's not here.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	437	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_c2c16c19	u	I actually do have a little pain from my last fight, but that's to be expected after all the adrenaline's worn off.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	438	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_f94f3d77	au	Aww, you poor thing. Don't force yourself to sit in pain. I can help work out the tension if you'd like?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	443	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_08bc7815	u	*Chuckles* I'm fine, trust me.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	448	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_c821d04b	au	If you say so. *Chuckles* So, tell me about that last fight of yours. I don't get to see much of the outside world since I'm always working on the ship. Was it a pretty big fight?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	453	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_b16fed3c	u	It was a serious fight. I'm surprised you haven't heard about it yet. It feels as if the whole world watched it.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	461	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_4046006a	u	Nah, it was light work. No fight is a big fight for me anymore.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	468	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_e0ef9d2e	au	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	473	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_4075a964	u	So this is how it starts. The bell rings and he just dashes towards me throwing swing after swing. I'm dodging and weaving, dodging and weaving. He's not landing a single hit.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	478	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_e1f58f87	au	Wowww! You're that good, huh?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	483	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_68d93517	u	Never lost a fight.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	488	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_a3349de3	au	Ooh, impressive. *Chuckles* What happened next?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	493	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_d0d40549	u	So like I said, I'm dodging every swing and thinking that he's got nothing on me.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	498	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_08d254e1	u	I end up getting a little cocky and drop my arms to taunt him a bit, when suddenly out of nowhere he slugs me real good right across the jaw.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	499	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_3bf9157a	u	He didn't knock me out, but the hit was just hard enough for me to start taking the fight a little bit more seriously.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	500	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_30d3f5cf	au	Is that why you're hurting a bit, from the jaw punch?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	505	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_15142b9c	u	That punch and many more.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	510	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_6e7f7767	au	So how'd you come back and win it after that horrible hit?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	515	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_64eb6ebe	u	Apparently he could tell how good of a hit he got on me because with a big smile on his face he began raising his hands in the air as if he had won, and that was all I needed to finish him.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	520	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_4d80f7d1	au	*Gasps* Finish him?! *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	525	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_e441b188	u	*Chuckles* I hit him as hard as I could square in the gut. Then again and again until he couldn't even manage to block himself.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	530	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_45efec3e	u	He clung on to me in an attempt to not fall down. Finally, I landed my last gut punch as hard as I could and he fell to the ground, knocked out cold.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	531	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_a384f93a	au	Oh my goodness... I can't even imagine. He must have needed some serious medical attention after the fight.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	536	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_ed067e3d	u	Oh yeah. They actually had to carry him out of the place. I'm one tough son of a bitch.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	541	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_52ded90b	au	I think I'd like to see exactly how tough you actually are. I... I think I see some bruising. Oh my gosh, and your eye is cut! I'm gonna need to patch that up immediately.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	546	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_35084c47	au	Oh, sweetie. If I didn't take a look at this I wouldn't be able to call myself a nurse. Please come by my office so I can get you fixed up.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	555	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_6a2916e5	au	I'll need some privacy to give the best treatment possible.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	558	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_4998a13d	au	*Whisper* Meet me in the bathroom.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	563	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_d217aa40	au	I'd prefer a little bit of privacy away from hawkeye Mr. Lee, so come hang with me in the bathroom.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	569	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_181bf28f	u	Whatever you say Miss Nurse. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	574	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_40033e41	au	Good, and try not to take too long. Those injuries look very, very bad. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	579	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_80057659	u	Haha, really? I didn't even feel it. After my fight I left the arena and hopped right on the ship. Haven't even had a moment to take a look.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	591	u "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_4952307a	au	My oh my... You really are one tough cookie I suppose. Maybe you could protect me from whoever this murderer may be?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	596	au "[what]"
v12s7_aubrey1_8e02de0f	u	I'd love to stick around but I've got more investigating to do... Although, no need to worry. I'll be back to check on you... *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	601	u "[what]"

v12s7_chloe_kill_3cb1964a	cl	Because Mr. Lee has played a murder mystery before and he always chooses the same type of student to be the murderer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1370	cl "[what]"

v12s7_riley3a_77d67edd	ri	*Southern accent* But by who? If she really was killed it had to be someone that's moving around. Based on what I heard Imre say earlier I have to assume it's him for now.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1586	ri "[what]"

v12s7_riley3a_3f746669	u	Honestly, she thought it was me, but I can't blame her since you and I were the only people she talked to. She has to accuse somebody. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1616	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley3a_369a9a0b	ri	*Southern accent* Someone else must come by when neither of us were with her.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1621	ri "[what]"

v12s7_lauren1_f136150e	la	Because that's my character, he's a killer on the run.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1804	la "[what]"

v12s7_lauren1_a94e61ae	la	That would explain why he was so serious about us not breaking character.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1874	la "[what]"
v12s7_lauren1_05bb8ded	u	And him watching over us all rather than playing a role himself.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1879	u "[what]"
v12s7_lauren1_27ef83f6	la	Why a boxer for you then? It's not like he's concerned about the frat stuff.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1884	la "[what]"
v12s7_lauren1_cebdbdd0	u	I don't think it has anything to do with that, I'm actually not sure about my own role. But everyone else seems to have a personal conflict or serious joy in their role.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1889	u "[what]"
v12s7_lauren1_4ee84a1d	la	Yeah, Amber got security or whatever and she's taking advantage of it. She took my gum earlier after she searched me saying it was contraband. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	1894	la "[what]"

v12s7_ryan_imre1_85a4157e	u	Oh, that's unfortunate.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2157	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_e55bbe8e	u	As funny as it is, chill a little bit Ryan. You wouldn't be so happy if you were playing the wife. I'm sure Imre would be giving it to you good.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2165	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_7ab99afb	imre	BRO!!	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2170	imre "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_ef2f1671	u	What?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2175	u "[what]"

v12s7_ryan_imre1_f62f5e40	ry	Why can't we go?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2200	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_63e894d1	imre	We can't go because this man here is a lazy dumbass that quit his job. Now he's broke and living with me until he gets his life together. That's literally what our cards said.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2205	imre "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_14964ec3	u	Damn Ryan, you're kind of a dumbass.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2210	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_0954a8f5	ry	What can I say, it was in the pursuit of true love.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2215	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_905e573e	imre	Bro I'm not playing with you.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2220	imre "[what]"

v12s7_ryan_imre1_6928c484	u	It is kind of funny.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2244	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_6af7345d	ry	He's always the one instigating me and now the tables have turned.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2249	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_bfc67707	u	But hey, don't mess with him too much. I wouldn't be surprised if he actually hit you.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2254	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_b42afb85	ry	Haha, I may not be a famous boxer, but I'll be just fine.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2259	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_imre1_40ad6f23	u	Alright man.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2264	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_2165b9d1	u	Your wife still hasn't come back?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2288	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_815d7b65	ry	Nope, and I haven't seen Mr. Lee either so I'm just waiting here. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2296	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_b7fcac5f	u	Wow, you guys just won't ever get along, huh?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2301	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_fd90e59b	ry	Probably not, I can get over being in different frats, but I can't get over his disrespect. I know he's your friend and he's cool with you, but he's not cool with me.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2306	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_dc2ac04e	u	Ever thought about just apologizing to squash the beef?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2311	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_a97c90f1	ry	Ugh, no. *Chuckles* Being cool with him doesn't make my life any better.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2316	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_6038585c	u	Isn't being at odds with him making your life worse?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2321	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_7b7e1902	ry	No not really, honestly, it's the only thing that's really kept me from being bored on this trip.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2326	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_f6e7031d	u	You're not enjoying Europe?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2331	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_28bf2d7e	ry	Well, there is a certain someone that's been making it a little better.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2340	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_4da23ece	ry	Nope, all of my friends are back on campus for the most part.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2345	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_4d3fc017	u	Well, we're gonna be here in Paris for a bit and still have another stop after that so you should definitely try and enjoy it while you're here.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2350	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_a5315aa8	ry	Honestly I wouldn't know how else I can play into this role without continuing to piss Imre off. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2355	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_6afe8459	u	Yeah, it does seem to be part of your role.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2360	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_72c78c6d	ry	He's sensitive to anything gay, it makes it so easy to bother him. I told him I can't wait till tonight, that I was gonna show him a good time.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2365	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_10f21fd7	ry	If Mr. Lee wasn't nearby I don't know what he would've done, but his face got super red. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2366	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_f01591d2	u	*Laughs* Be careful, this is gonna be over eventually and he won't be worried about Mr. Lee anymore. He may just throw you overboard himself.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2371	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_79b4a6f3	ry	That would suck. I can barely swim.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2376	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_8d402e41	u	What? *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2381	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_e398450d	ry	What do you mean "what"?There's a lot of adults that don't know how to swim, and I'm not saying I don't know how to, I'm saying I barely know how to.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2386	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_b9898d16	u	*Laughs* How do you barely know how to swim?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2391	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_4282e782	ry	Because, I've never been swimming before, but like, I'm sure it's not that hard.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2396	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_9dbaecde	u	YOU'VE NEVER BEEN SWIMMING?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2401	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_fdd94041	ry	Bro chill, why you so loud? No, I haven't been swimming before. I don't see the big deal.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2406	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_698e599c	u	Maybe because we live in California right next to an ocean?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2411	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_163f9415	ry	I don't really like the ocean. You know we've only discovered like five percent of it? Nobody knows what's in there, and I'm not gonna be fish food.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2416	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_c53b1b1c	u	Haha, I'm gonna go let Mr. Lee know you want to get in the water.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2421	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_3f7deda2	ry	You do that and I'll let Charli know you want to be roommates in Paris.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2426	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_c8d1074c	u	I may be willing to take that risk. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2431	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan1_3be64406	ry	You're brave. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2436	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_kill_fda23e9a	u	Boom.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2452	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_kill_4d0c5672	ry	Wait, you're the killer?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2460	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_kill_ff223546	u	Yep.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2465	u "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_kill_e47fd058	ry	Oh shoot, that's great. The one thing Imre and I agree on is ending this game so hurry up and kill everyone.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2470	ry "[what]"
v12s7_ryan_kill_423c6f19	u	Haha, okay.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2475	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_1e8c4302	u	Hello Mrs.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2494	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_10fd14ca	imre	Get out of here with that shit bro.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2502	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_e43754f7	u	Bro chill out, why do you let that bother you so much?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2507	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_f12b8d87	imre	It's not bothering me anymore than it would bother anyone else. You guys are acting like I'm actually gay or something.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2512	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_ca21c5f3	u	I don't think that's what anyone is doing. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2517	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_015f9bb4	imre	Yeah you are, and we both know that's far from true. Always have and always will be a man of the ladies.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2522	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_228ec0aa	u	Not being able to take a joke and being super sensitive makes you look way more sus.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2527	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_321684f4	imre	No it doesn't, it needs to be known I don't rock like that. You, Charli and Ryan may think it's all fun and games, but I don't.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2532	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_2ee22002	u	If it really bothers you I can try and reel it back, but I can't make any promises. *Chuckles* At least not during the game.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2537	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_ee871324	imre	Man fuck this game, Mr. Lee literally did all of this just to fuck with me.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2542	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_56113c9d	u	You sure about that?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2547	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_d4a58972	imre	Ugh duh. He gave me the worst character, he's following me around, and threating to throw me in the fucking water. Yeah, he's just doing this to be a dick.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2552	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_1db02e63	imre	If I wasn't here you guys would be kicking back enjoying the breeze. If the fucking murderer would do his job or hurry up and get caught this would finally be over with.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2553	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_01c02c6f	u	So I guess that means you haven't found the killer and aren't the killer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2558	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_f5a4f08e	imre	I would've shut this shit down a long time ago if I was the killer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2563	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_26840762	u	So what's your plan to catch the killer then?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2568	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_8209c6af	imre	I haven't been able to do anything, because Mr. Lee won't let me breathe. He got distracted and it gave me a chance to get over here. He hasn't found me yet.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2573	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_31e1da3a	imre	If the killer would just kill me so I can be done with this that'd be great. Then Ryan can be a dumbass widow with no job on a cruise by himself walking around like an idiot.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2574	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_586cd461	u	Seems like you're enjoying his character's sad story quite a bit.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2579	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_38371aa2	imre	It just fits him well.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2584	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_40ad2361	u	Well, good luck dying.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2589	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_bb60348b	imre	This is the first time I've said "kill me now" and actually meant it. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2594	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre2_fcc18885	u	*Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2599	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_fda23e9a	u	Boom.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2615	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_a9430214	imre	Please tell me you're not joking with me right now?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2623	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_976a075c	u	Haha, nope, I'm actually the killer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2628	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_ed115a81	imre	FREEDOM!!!	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2634	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_eefed9e7	u	Bro hush. *Chuckles* I have more people to kill.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2639	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_323444b0	imre	Sorry man, I just feel so good right now. It feels good to be dead. Thanks man.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2644	imre "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_54b7523c	u	Haha, you're welcome.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2649	u "[what]"
v12s7_imre_kill_5fce8d35	u	(He's crazy. *Chuckles*)	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2654	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_e068b7b7	u	Surprised we haven't crashed yet.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2670	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_6994b47d	li	Hey hey, got any good leads for us? I ran everything over with the Captain and we haven't come up with anything.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2683	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_5ae69c00	u	I've got nothing, haven't been doing much looking around.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2688	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_4943de9f	charli	Murderers don't need to look around for the murderer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2693	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_02a6193c	li	And you think he's the murderer because...	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2698	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_056914d4	charli	Mr. Lee gave us our roles and it would make sense to me that he'd choose [name] as the killer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2703	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_6b3a3f06	li	Well, let's not jump to conclusions. So far, based on my notes I've ruled out some people. I've ruled out Imre, Ryan, and Amber.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2708	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_fbcf0b70	u	How'd you rule them out?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2713	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_d7da7292	li	Well, it was actually Charli. Charli, do you want to explain?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2718	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_9f9a3d0c	charli	You may have a hard time understanding so try and focus.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2723	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_57ae9944	u	*Sighs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2728	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_1fc8f12b	charli	Imre wants the game to be over, if he was the murderer he would've killed Ryan in front of someone in order to get caught.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2733	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_6c71cf84	charli	Ryan would have killed Imre out of frustration and Amber has had too many opportunities to kill people yet she hasn't. So we know none of them are the killer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2734	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_74d6accc	u	Are there people you're suspicious of?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2739	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_6fa787c4	charli	Outside of you, no.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2744	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_ea1ccb3c	li	I have other suspicions, as a detective it's my job to be open minded. I'm suspecting Lauren.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2749	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_fb608404	charli	Because she's a criminal.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2754	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_c1f92966	li	Well, yes.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2759	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_ec7d5895	charli	*Chuckles* It's definitely not her, too obvious and Mr. Lee would never choose her.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2764	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_ca1c2bf8	li	Or that's what he wants you to think. When solving a problem, you always gotta work backwards, that way you're never surprised by what's to come.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2769	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_1afd1044	u	Yeah, c'mon now Charli.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2774	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_8e6a4518	charli	I'm not sure that applies here., I'm itching to use my PA system though, so once you find something worth announcing please let me know.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2779	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_2c607ab5	li	Only if you let me join you.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2784	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_e4632cf5	charli	I don't see why not.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2789	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_f4e6570c	li	Good, [name]. You sure there's nothing you've seen?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2794	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_4ab862d0	u	Well, I did see Ryan say something about wiping everyone out. He said it to Imre, but I don't know what the context was.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2802	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_6e9bf3bd	charli	Throwing the blame, huh?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2807	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_491f579e	u	Uhh no, just saying what I heard.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2812	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_fb065a6b	u	Nope, nothing. Haven't got a clue who it is.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2818	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_bcfea071	charli	Don't want to admit it's you, but also don't want to look suspicious by passing the blame. You're too predictable.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2823	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_285608e2	u	Whatever you say man. Don't let that Captain shit go to your head.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2828	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_a2b96ec5	li	Hmmm, well I'm gonna start with Ryan. I know we ruled him out but I'm still suspicious.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2833	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_8af5897a	charli	So you're leaving me here then?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2838	charli "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_042a8f6a	li	Yeah, sorry. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2843	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_charli1_39aaee93	u	Isn't it smarter to stay up here the whole time? You know Charli isn't the killer, plus Amber is supposed to be keeping you guys updated, right?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2850	u "[what]"

v12s7_lindsey_charli1_34db8439	u	Ha, I couldn't be a good guy to you even in a made up scenario.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2918	u "[what]"

v12s7_lindsey2_4f3d01e6	li	It is, several people on board have told me Ryan aka Mr. Stork has not only mentioned killing people, but that he wants to see if he can kill everyone on board without being caught.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2987	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_22ca8425	u	That would explain why he hasn't killed Imre or anyone in front of Imre.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2992	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_ce39d24d	li	Exactly, because it's Imre's or Mrs. Stork's ultimate goal to end the game.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	2997	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_cc274be4	u	Have you spoken to the Storks, maybe try and get them to separate?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3002	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_5dd92cb3	li	I considered it, but it's too risky. With it being so easy to murder without being caught and me being the main one interested in catching the murderer, I can't risk getting killed.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3007	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_8c3c5fc1	u	Well... sacrifice someone.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3012	u "[what]"

v12s7_lindsey2_b97c6150	u	Just start talking to people about how vulnerable Charli is and see who takes the bait.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3042	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_b1dabbcd	li	Hmmm, not a bad idea.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3047	li "[what]"

v12s7_lindsey2_af32fac9	li	Oh no, I'm definitely running. I'm saying I'm not stressed about it anymore. Most of the girls are cool with me running, I have a gameplan to persuade the others, so right now I'm happy just enjoying Europe.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3077	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_764aa7de	u	You never fail to amaze me Lindsey.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3082	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_ab1ca9ab	li	I didn't become a detective by not being great.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3087	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_deb004e9	u	Mr. Lee obviously chose all of our characters with a purpose. Why do you think he chose for you to be a detective?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3092	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_39952027	li	I'm not sure, but I have been wondering.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3097	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_70efd487	u	Does he know about the Chicks stuff?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3102	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_daedf9db	li	There's no telling what he knows and doesn't know. It seems as though Mr. Lee knows everything.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3107	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_79e72527	u	You're not wrong about that. Question, why didn't you think I was the killer?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3112	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_a4dbc0dc	li	I wouldn't say I didn't think you were. I wasn't one way or the other, but Charli just had such an obvious bias so I didn't want to be blinded by that.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3117	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_48aeda02	u	What if you're blinded by liking me?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3122	u "[what]"

v12s7_lindsey2_44721488	li	Oh that's not fair, you just tried to hit me with a trap question. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3137	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_16e920b0	u	Oh no it's fine, Charli's got me used to not being liked.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3142	u "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_c7f6e755	li	Well, I definitely don't dislike you... But that has nothing to do with the game and I'm not getting thrown overboard so I'm getting back to my investigation.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3156	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey2_b1cc772c	u	Ha, you do that.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3161	u "[what]"

v12s7_lindsey_kill_c7ca4c4a	li	Maybe I should listen to Charli more often. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3197	li "[what]"
v12s7_lindsey_kill_a2dd3d96	u	Or not, that'd work too.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3202	u "[what]"

v12s7_amber1_3eaa6a36	u	What... I mean, I don't know what's considered contraband.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3955	u "[what]"
v12s7_amber1_f4795023	am	You still said what, now I feel like you're just trying to make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	3960	am "[what]"

v12s7_riley2_074f018e	u	Fine then, I won't do it. *Chuckles* Why aren't you being all serious, you were so excited about this.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4143	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_90776645	ri	Chris is just upsetting me a bit.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4148	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_66495e60	u	How come?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4153	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_a65fe06e	ri	He isn't taking his role seriously at all, he's literally doing nothing.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4158	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_6368bd42	u	Maybe this just isn't for everybody.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4163	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_0d737778	ri	I know it's not for everybody, but there's more to it than that. As I've gotten to know and been around Chris it just seems as though he only does what he wants to do.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4168	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_441f0750	ri	Most times what he wants to do is the right thing, but it's still a little selfish in my opinion.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4169	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_1f7f91c4	u	I didn't know you had beef with Chris.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4174	u "[what]"

v12s7_riley2_97fb0e43	u	Gonna be a little hard to just forget. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4184	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_30a94e4f	ri	If I knock you out will that help?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4189	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_0586cc27	u	So many violent people on this ship.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4194	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_8386c124	ri	One is a violent murderer and if Chris would take his role seriously it'd be easier to find out who. He's literally the only cook.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4199	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_0bb439a6	u	How can the cook be helpful? *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4204	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_a50a5e99	ri	I asked Mr. Lee if we could get hints from the people in the hallway and he said the only person able to talk to the people in the hallway for clues is the cook aka Chris. I talked to Chris and he refused to help.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4209	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_d0dc5c9e	u	Why'd he refuse?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4214	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_dc26b5f7	ri	Like I said, selfish. He's just holding his phone trying to get a signal like it's gonna magically connect even though it's not working for anyone.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4219	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_71468422	u	He's trying to get back in touch with Sebastian, he's been on the phone a lot so whatever they're discussing must be major. His head may be in a whole other world. Then add on top of that his issues with Nora.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4224	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_ac596a5d	ri	He wouldn't have issues with Nora if he'd know how to prioritize.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4229	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_88d30e35	u	On another topic...	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4234	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_308a18f0	ri	You're right, not my business. Gosh, I just want to find out who the killer is already.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4239	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_8fc3e55a	u	Don't we all?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4244	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_9b60ac2e	ri	Not everyone.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4249	ri "[what]"

v12s7_riley2_08e37a58	u	I'm a successful and famous boxer, I don't take orders.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4264	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_7721f584	ri	*Southern accent* Look here champ, take a few benjamins for yourself and just do what I asked, alright?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4269	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_d684256c	u	Hmmm, I guess I could make that happen.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4274	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley2_3b6f8335	ri	*Southern accent* Good, get to it.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4279	ri "[what]"

v12s7_riley_kill2_948164de	u	Haha, Mr. Lee chose a good murderer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4310	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley_kill2_84f0c9ce	ri	How'd I not know? So many people thought it was Imre as he was getting on Mr. Lee's nerves. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4315	ri "[what]"
v12s7_riley_kill2_b7f2741f	u	Nope, it was the beautiful famous boxer. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4320	u "[what]"
v12s7_riley_kill2_15839eb5	ri	Wow, well I guess since you killed me I can root for you. So good luck.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4325	ri "[what]"

v12s7_sam_cameron_51776af9	u	You really think you can take on Chris?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4613	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam_cameron_ec9103dc	ca	With one hand behind my back.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4618	ca "[what]"
v12s7_sam_cameron_7587e6d2	u	Right.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4623	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_2599ac53	u	No bodyguard?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4644	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_76988b6a	sa	You mean no stalker.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4652	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_ff358c11	u	Haha, you really weren't enjoying his jokes were you?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4657	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_8ef23b5a	sa	Not at all. Even if some of them were a little funny, I don't think it's cool that all of his jokes are about orphans. The whole idea of orphans just isn't funny to me at all.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4662	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_33fb8659	u	I feel where you're coming from.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4667	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_2179fe00	sa	*Whisper* He should know better.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4672	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_e705cdf3	u	Is there anything I can do to cheer you up a bit?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4677	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_8c2ce65b	sa	Besides distracting my mind with something else? *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4682	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_1b53551c	u	Wanna focus on the game? That's the point of all of this, I think... To make us focus on something else for a while.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4690	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_95d5275c	u	I think this might help you think about something else...	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4698	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_17b10a38	sa	What-	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4703	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_34d73f74	sa	Oh... Yeah. *Chuckles* That definitely helps.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4714	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_ab749b87	u	(Shit!) That might be Mr. Lee, shh!	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4721	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_65801db3	sa	Quick, talk murder to me. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4726	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_6fd14e54	u	Well, let's see, novelist, can you pinpoint our murderer?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4731	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_db290bd6	sa	Well if I was writing this, I'd probably choose Lauren to be the murderer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4736	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_693b3993	u	What? There's no way it'd be her.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4741	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_9129e359	sa	See, that's exactly why I'd choose her. No one would suspect her. She wouldn't even suspect herself. *Chuckles*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4746	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_18df6ae9	u	Hmm, that's pretty smart.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4751	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_e0429848	sa	You sound surprised. *Chuckles* Did you think I was stupid?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4756	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_4403754f	u	I may have wondered if it ran in the family.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4761	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_f2e59a62	sa	My brother took all the stupid.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4766	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_77c817f7	u	That's believable.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4771	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_c269c8bf	sa	Honestly, my life sucks. I'm an adult in college, but instead of having friends and living the life I want to live...	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4776	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_709f74d2	sa	I'm smothered by my brother for literally no reason except he has nothing better to do. I just want to be my own person.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4777	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_0c02facf	u	Get a restraining order.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4782	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_329604e3	sa	I've thought about it, but I don't want to take it that far. I just want him to take my wishes into consideration for once.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4787	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_c3ad0ce1	u	Maybe he does it because he cares, but gets carried away.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4792	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_8fed0247	sa	He sure gets carried away a lot.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4797	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_de473765	u	Haha, yeah. You mentioned Lauren, do you talk to her?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4802	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_8eb27ca2	sa	I haven't, but I don't think we'd get along, she's too soft.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4807	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_3a462014	u	I wouldn't jump to conclusions, just because someone is kind doesn't mean they're soft.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4812	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_d8473a60	sa	I've never seen or heard of her doing anything exciting.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4817	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_9d2a66e8	u	Well, you're not in her circle. Would you believe it if I told you on the very first day of school Riley, Imre, Lauren and I played Drink or Strip?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4822	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_7bd31ab8	sa	There's no way Lauren played that with you guys.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4827	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_17fb8c9b	u	She did. C'mon now, don't judge a book until you've read it all the way through.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4832	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_88397b80	sa	Hmm, maybe I should try talking to her. Someone I definitely wanna talk to though is Amber.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4837	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_86e43d43	sa	After seeing how feisty she's been with the whole security thing I definitely wanna get to know her. She seems like my type of person, plus I know her and Riley are cool.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4838	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_00c69058	u	See, look at that, so many opportunities.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4843	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_c94d8969	sa	Yeah, I guess you're right.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4848	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_a4d763ba	u	When am I not?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4853	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_4369ae12	sa	Don't ruin the moment.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4858	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_51b30d5a	u	Haha, my bad.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4863	u "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_3e0216ee	sa	Well, I need to finish my book. If I don't, no one will. See you around [name] and thanks for the talk.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4868	sa "[what]"
v12s7_sam2_173f2156	u	Anytime.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4873	u "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_fda23e9a	u	Boom.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4892	u "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_b13a7cf3	sa	There's no way he chose you as the killer.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4900	sa "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_86a9e1ee	u	He did.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4905	u "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_1f893bea	sa	I'm having a hard time believing that.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4910	sa "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_c60601fb	u	Why is that so hard to believe?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4915	u "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_3a73db82	sa	You don't fit any killer theories.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4920	sa "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_4a226817	u	Doesn't that make me the perfect choice then?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4925	u "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_d373dd23	sa	I guess. Why didn't you kill me earlier?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4930	sa "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_0d086675	u	You were with your brother, and I didn't want to get caught.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4935	u "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_8979f63a	sa	He's not a part of the game idiot?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4940	sa "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_ebe5dbd5	u	*Laughs* Oh yeah.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4945	u "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_7cec54be	sa	Enjoy your little killing spree, good luck.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4950	sa "[what]"
v12s7_samantha_kill_cb046e78	u	Later.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4955	u "[what]"

v12s7_cameron2_92386198	ca	I whipped up some more jokes.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4994	ca "[what]"
v12s7_cameron2_9c86798f	u	Are they orphan jokes?	game/v12/scene7.rpy	4999	u "[what]"

v12s7_cameron2_cf52a76c	ca	An apple gets picked. *Laughs*	game/v12/scene7.rpy	5024	ca "[what]"
v12s7_cameron2_3d7e8b2c	u	That's dark.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	5029	u "[what]"
v12s7_cameron2_0ad3ba01	ca	I got more, I got more.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	5034	ca "[what]"

v12s7_nora1_14257095	u	Maybe it was planned prior, I'm sure it was.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	5135	u "[what]"
v12s7_nora1_7e488def	no	Then he should've been a little more considerate and canceled it.	game/v12/scene7.rpy	5140	no "[what]"

v13_start_c6c97455	ri	I want you to sneak into Charli's room and destroy his suitcase.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	78	ri "[what]"
v13_start_1d9ff238	u	Okay, but... Why his suitcase?	game/v13/scene1.rpy	83	u "[what]"
v13_start_098b675a	ri	Charli told me back in London that his grandmother gave it to him when he came out to her, so it's extremely special to him. That's what makes it the perfect target.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	88	ri "[what]"
v13_start_e58d27c3	u	This is a bit of a dark side for you, you know? I thought you were a nice girl... *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene1.rpy	93	u "[what]"
v13_start_07b5f16f	ri	Nope, never claimed to be! I just act accordingly. If people are nice to me I'll be an angel, but the minute they cross me, I cross them.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	98	ri "[what]"
v13_start_368bd8e4	u	Seems fair. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene1.rpy	103	u "[what]"
v13_start_51911626	ri	And fairness is exactly why I assumed you'd wanna help.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	108	ri "[what]"
v13_start_931a9f0f	ri	I know Charli's been a pain in your ass since the moment you met him, so I didn't think you'd second-guess helping. Especially when you consider the fact that he tried framing you.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	113	ri "[what]"
v13_start_72cf8418	u	Oh, don't worry. I've been waiting for a moment like this.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	118	u "[what]"
v13_start_5a40e2c8	ri	That's what I thought. *Chuckles* Now, I'm not sure when we'll be able to do it... Once I get the layout of Amsterdam's hotel I'll let you know. Remember this though... Bleach.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	123	ri "[what]"
v13_start_9b7a65be	u	Bleach?	game/v13/scene1.rpy	128	u "[what]"
v13_start_cec7900a	ri	Yep. There's been some in every hotel we've stayed at so far, under the sink in the bathrooms... You can ruin anything with a little bleach.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	133	ri "[what]"
v13_start_e5e06e74	u	Perfect, I'll keep that in mind. Do you know when we're leaving for Amsterdam? I thought we'd be going early this morning.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	138	u "[what]"
v13_start_68e02dea	ri	As far as I know, we-	game/v13/scene1.rpy	143	ri "[what]"
v13_start_74e24ff1	ro	ALRIGHT STUDENTS! LET'S GET OUR THINGS AND GET ON THE BUS!	game/v13/scene1.rpy	148	ro "[what]"
v13_start_520f7a01	u	Guess that answers my question. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene1.rpy	156	u "[what]"
v13_start_be7aeb77	ri	See you on the bus! I'm sure it's like a seven or eight hour ride so you'll be able to sleep most of the way. No murder to commit this time. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene1.rpy	166	ri "[what]"
v13_start_5ceeadc8	u	Thank God! Haha, I'll catch you later.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	171	u "[what]"
v13_start_26a99ca4	ri	Umm, actually...	game/v13/scene1.rpy	176	ri "[what]"
v13_start_a3a5fd57	ri	I hope you know that I really am sorry, [name]. I'm doing my best to act fine but, how I treated you is still really bothering me.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	181	ri "[what]"
v13_start_13fea20b	u	Just don't let it happen again, okay? I don't like being blamed for shit I didn't do.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	190	u "[what]"
v13_start_6523c6d9	ri	Of course, and I know you're a true friend. I won't jump to conclusions so quickly in the future.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	195	ri "[what]"
v13_start_b51f84f0	u	It's fine Riley, really. Of course I was pissed at first, it's a little upsetting to have one of your best friends calling you a liar but... I can't stay mad at you forever. Apology accepted.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	204	u "[what]"
v13_start_709c1399	ri	Well... It's not fine, and I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions like that so fast. Your forgiveness means everything to me, though.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	209	ri "[what]"
v13_start_e780ff24	ri	I promise I'll make it up to you.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	219	ri "[what]"
v13_start_5a8b7caa	u	Your Charli plan is a pretty good start, haha.	game/v13/scene1.rpy	224	u "[what]"

v13s12c_c97b2d5c	au	But no matter what, if she's frustrated, she's gonna bring that energy into the house. And that's the exact kind of shit that I don't want to deal with.	game/v13/scene12c.rpy	290	au "[what]"
v13s12c_be05089f	u	I gotcha... We still have a few more days though, and right now you're chilling with me. So, I'd say Amsterdam started off with a bang for you.	game/v13/scene12c.rpy	295	u "[what]"

v13s12c_99c1503c	u	Chloe is a senior and the current President, which means at some point people obviously had faith in her leadership.	game/v13/scene12c.rpy	348	u "[what]"
v13s12c_bcc4e457	u	If people are losing faith in her, they can always just wait until next year. Lindsey included.	game/v13/scene12c.rpy	353	u "[what]"
v13s12c_b5d93291	u	Lindsey clearly is passionate about making good improvements to the sorority and has a lot of support already...	game/v13/scene12c.rpy	359	u "[what]"
v13s12c_b8f60680	u	It puts Chloe in an odd position, but I feel like it's best she takes one for the team.	game/v13/scene12c.rpy	364	u "[what]"
v13s12c_56dadd41	au	I now realize that even after hearing what you'd do, it doesn't make my decision any easier.	game/v13/scene12c.rpy	369	au "[what]"

v13s22_48b574f5	u	Charli has been writing finals and taking exams for students in Mr. Lee's class, and making bank while at it.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	47	u "[what]"

v13s22_06366f31	u	I sure the fuck did! It's about time he got a taste of his own medicine. He made it worse by trying Mr. Lee like that.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	68	u "[what]"

v13s22_1e5e46e5	au	You ratted him out... I would've made him give me a cut to keep my mouth shut. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene22.rpy	78	au "[what]"
v13s22_16a019bb	ri	Not a bad idea... *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene22.rpy	83	ri "[what]"
v13s22_bfa96342	u	I could've, but I confronted him instead.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	89	u "[what]"
v13s22_403bf873	au	How'd he react?	game/v13/scene22.rpy	94	au "[what]"
v13s22_580e4930	u	He tried to deny it, then tried threatening me for breaking into his room.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	99	u "[what]"
v13s22_37b7f450	u	Eventually, he realized he has no choice but to give in and said when we get back he's gonna stay away from me.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	101	u "[what]"
v13s22_fea5e384	u	From all of us.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	103	u "[what]"
v13s22_a0b2e3a4	au	So, you just let him go? Didn't even make him pay you to stay quiet?	game/v13/scene22.rpy	113	au "[what]"
v13s22_ff4f4c6f	ri	Yeah, that actually would've been a good idea... *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene22.rpy	118	ri "[what]"
v13s22_0567a039	u	I just let him go, I'd rather not see him again. Dealing with his bullshit isn't worth some dollars.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	123	u "[what]"
v13s22_aa863068	au	To you. *Laughs*	game/v13/scene22.rpy	128	au "[what]"

v13s22_63c98225	ri	First and last straw, for me too. That picture was not something I wanted to share with everyone.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	163	ri "[what]"
v13s22_74891ac2	au	Oh my god, Riley... That picture was nothing. We all have a silly childhood picture. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene22.rpy	168	au "[what]"
v13s22_1b1f9b2c	au	I have some crazy pictures and when we go inside, I'll show you. Maybe then you'll stop being so insecure.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	170	au "[what]"
v13s22_4ee6187b	ri	I probably shouldn't have been so serious about the picture, but I think I just felt more disrespected than embarrassed.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	175	ri "[what]"
v13s22_5180fa8a	au	Well, the one that disrespected you won't be a problem anymore.	game/v13/scene22.rpy	180	au "[what]"

v13s23_3428cc24	imre	I don't want you to come, but two people isn't enough and Chris didn't wanna go out. So, here we are. It was either Chris or Mr. Lee, and he's a little occupied right now.	game/v13/scene23.rpy	33	imre "[what]"
v13s23_42b2727e	ry	Oh yeah, what was all that yelling about? Did someone break one of his precious valuables or something?	game/v13/scene23.rpy	40	ry "[what]"

v13s23_749e576b	u	Hell yeah I did. He kind of did it to himself but, I just had to press the right button. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene23.rpy	69	u "[what]"
v13s23_f5676e34	ry	Well, good. Now Imre can stop talking about how he's gonna kick his ass every day. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene23.rpy	75	ry "[what]"

v13s5a_33d2ce9b	ri	So, I just so happened to see what room Charli is in... While I dream about how to play decoy, you dream about means of destruction.	game/v13/scene5a.rpy	42	ri "[what]"
v13s5a_29e64b5c	u	Haha, I can do that. You wanna stay up and run over some plans?	game/v13/scene5a.rpy	47	u "[what]"
v13s5a_d98f92f3	ri	Somebody's eager. *Chuckles* Not tonight though, goodnight.	game/v13/scene5a.rpy	52	ri "[what]"
v13s5a_7add989e	u	Haha, goodnight.	game/v13/scene5a.rpy	57	u "[what]"
v13s06_7f996fde	u	(Waking up on my own, Amsterdam is starting out nice. *Chuckles*)	game/v13/scene6.rpy	17	u "[what]"
v13s06_0408dccb	u	Hello.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	37	u "[what]"
v13s06_603ef0a2	luuk	Sleepy field trip kid! Good morning.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	42	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_8b258704	u	Huh?	game/v13/scene6.rpy	47	u "[what]"
v13s06_87d46caf	luuk	My name is Luuk, I saw you last night with the rest of the students and overheard your conversation.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	52	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_b944ff66	u	Ahh, guess nothing gets past you, huh?	game/v13/scene6.rpy	57	u "[what]"
v13s06_1606a6b0	luuk	For a price, I can hear or not hear anything... So, whether you want to have some fun or stay out of trouble, I'm your guy.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	62	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_b8a31fd8	u	That's a bold approach for someone you just met.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	67	u "[what]"
v13s06_446d3ce3	luuk	I work at a hotel, everyone I talk to is someone I just met. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene6.rpy	72	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_e90bde5a	u	*Chuckles* Fair enough.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	77	u "[what]"
v13s06_0f667cbd	luuk	So, was there a reason you came over?	game/v13/scene6.rpy	82	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_099d0d27	u	Yeah, actually. We've been staying in Peace Hotels our entire trip, and I tried the breakfast in Paris and loved it. I was wondering if you guys had breakfast here in Amsterdam as well?	game/v13/scene6.rpy	87	u "[what]"
v13s06_105ab2c3	luuk	We normally do, but I'm sorry to say we don't this morning. There was a minor staffing situation so we had to cancel breakfast for today.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	92	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_81e13938	u	Oh, okay. Thanks for the info.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	97	u "[what]"
v13s06_15fc4831	luuk	Since you enjoyed the breakfast so much, come by again sometime before you leave and I'll personally make your meal.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	102	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_9c9b8a0d	u	So you're a confidence man and a chef?	game/v13/scene6.rpy	107	u "[what]"
v13s06_b8defaf3	luuk	It's good to possess many conflicting skills. No one expects a confidence man to be a good cook and no one expects the cook to be a confidence man.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	112	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_f599782e	u	Huh... You've really thought this through. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene6.rpy	117	u "[what]"
v13s06_aedab0ce	luuk	Haha, let's just say I make more money scheming with the guests than I do checking them in.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	122	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_9d6f835a	u	Hmm. I may have to get in on that.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	127	u "[what]"
v13s06_d09cc295	luuk	You're not built for this kind of life, trust me. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene6.rpy	132	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_15ac0275	u	Of course I am.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	139	u "[what]"
v13s06_d99dfb80	u	Do you see this? I have all the muscle you need.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	149	u "[what]"
v13s06_cede5d4d	luuk	Impressive. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene6.rpy	154	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_ab3b95ae	u	Yeah, probably not. More of a straight and narrow kind of guy.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	160	u "[what]"
v13s06_e116ec3b	luuk	Playing it safe always guarantees safety.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	165	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_d004697c	u	I was always told "cowards live longer".	game/v13/scene6.rpy	170	u "[what]"
v13s06_d1f9aeb6	luuk	That they do. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene6.rpy	175	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_351fb9a5	luuk	Well... I'll see you soon for another breakfast. *Laughs* Also, remember what I said. I hear it all or don't hear anything.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	180	luuk "[what]"
v13s06_e4e64f30	u	I... heard... you.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	185	u "[what]"
v13s06_377fa902	luuk	Clever.	game/v13/scene6.rpy	190	luuk "[what]"
v13s60_f274cdc9	au	Hey, would you mind taking another pic for me so I can post it to my Kiwii?	game/v13/scene60.rpy	22	au "[what]"
v13s60_225a8c75	u	You're gonna need to put me on payroll eventually. *Laughs* How do you want them?	game/v13/scene60.rpy	27	u "[what]"
v13s60_74503c68	au	*Chuckles* I was thinking something from a higher angle if we could.	game/v13/scene60.rpy	32	au "[what]"
v13s60_110ad001	au	Think you can get up there?	game/v13/scene60.rpy	42	au "[what]"
v13s60_4d1553f2	u	I'm sure I can get up there, but it does look pretty risky.	game/v13/scene60.rpy	47	u "[what]"
v13s60_f122006d	au	Pleaseeeeee?	game/v13/scene60.rpy	52	au "[what]"

v13s60_7a5fa0e8	u	My... My vision is going blurry...	game/v13/scene60.rpy	114	u "[what]"
v13s60_ba6bc577	au	I'm gonna get you back to the hotel, just bear with me, okay?	game/v13/scene60.rpy	124	au "[what]"
v13s61_dcedbc66	au	Hey there... How are you feeling?	game/v13/scene61.rpy	22	au "[what]"
v13s61_79a98b53	u	I feel like I'm blacking out.	game/v13/scene61.rpy	27	u "[what]"

v13s61_1906699e	u	Don't worry about it, Aubrey. It's not your fault I can't climb. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene61.rpy	72	u "[what]"
v13s61_2ec6d181	au	I'm glad you still have your sense of humor... Get some rest.	game/v13/scene61.rpy	82	au "[what]"

v13s62_6f64cbe0	au	Since both of us have been a little mean to him recently, we should probably make him feel better, right?	game/v13/scene62.rpy	57	au "[what]"
v13s62_a3aa73c7	ri	I think I'd have to agree with that. *Chuckles* What'd you have in mind?	game/v13/scene62.rpy	62	ri "[what]"
v13s62_c22228bc	u	Oh, wow...	game/v13/scene62.rpy	67	u "[what]"

v13_ticket_transfer_1005db25	lee	[name], my boy!	game/v13/scene7.rpy	13	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_7cbc76d9	u	Yes?	game/v13/scene7.rpy	18	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_ac22f7de	lee	A lot has been going on lately. With the trip, things back on campus, and with students who I wish required less attention so that I could focus on students I'd much rather focus on... Like you.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	23	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_d737eba7	u	Me? *Chuckles* Why me?	game/v13/scene7.rpy	28	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_90189303	lee	It's not everyday you find a skilled murderer amongst your students.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	33	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_ee44bf7f	u	Oh, that... *Laughs*	game/v13/scene7.rpy	38	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_8fbcff66	lee	Give yourself more credit than you have! You accomplished something that is not so easily accomplished.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	43	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_adadc4e2	u	Well... Thank you.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	48	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_75d5832a	lee	Of course. Hmm, I'm curious... Are you familiar with the story of Genghis Khan?	game/v13/scene7.rpy	53	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_938aa3c7	u	Somewhat...	game/v13/scene7.rpy	58	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_7c71d984	lee	Well, in my opinion, you and him share many similar characteristics. Many of which you demonstrated on the ferry.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	63	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_409516e9	u	Okay... I don't get it.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	68	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_1cff3909	lee	Let me explain my thoughts.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	73	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_6f72cec3	lee	Genghis, though considered by some to be a barbarian, had patience, a father's perception skill, and sheer brilliance in enacting his plans. That was you!	game/v13/scene7.rpy	78	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_f42f654c	lee	I'm not familiar with your love life, but it's also known that he had thousands of women which he called his wives.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	82	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_792b51bc	u	(Ha, I think I like being compared to this guy.)	game/v13/scene7.rpy	87	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_66cead6a	lee	All in all, Genghis set in motion his plans and then reaped what he sowed. So, I felt it was appropriate that you do as well.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	92	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_2d559027	u	What's this?	game/v13/scene7.rpy	102	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_269d7a75	lee	They are tickets to a nearby concert. I felt someone your age would enjoy them.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	107	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_e90039c5	u	Wow, thanks. I'm surprised you got me these, haha.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	112	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_4d3394fd	lee	Frankly, it wasn't what I had originally gotten for you.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	117	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_36bca79d	u	(He probably got some old history thing the first time.)	game/v13/scene7.rpy	122	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_dc5ded48	lee	I had gotten you an old medallion that was significant to the real world event, but it appears it's been misplaced or worse... stolen.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	127	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_665dae89	u	(Yep, an old history thing.)	game/v13/scene7.rpy	132	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_3d516b34	u	*Chuckles* This was really nice of you, Mr. Lee. You didn't have to do this. I'm pretty sure these were expensive...	game/v13/scene7.rpy	134	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_a33f25b6	lee	*Laughs* Have you ever heard me complain about money?	game/v13/scene7.rpy	139	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_d5f2a82b	u	Well... No.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	144	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_872e8249	lee	And you never will. Money isn't ever an issue.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	149	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_cd80f3df	lee	Now, have a good time at the concert.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	154	lee "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_01325ab8	u	*Laughs* (Did he just lowkey flex on me and then walk off? Haha, he gave me two concert tickets as well...)	game/v13/scene7.rpy	159	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_2bd65d80	u	(And these have backstage passes! Holy shit, he really went all out.)	game/v13/scene7.rpy	166	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_ac2e92d1	u	(Wait what?! Including backstage passes and after party access?! Holy shit, Mr. Lee... Definitely a flex, but I'll take it, nonetheless.) *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene7.rpy	172	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_93c80bf3	u	(Who should I take with me?)	game/v13/scene7.rpy	177	u "[what]"

v13_ticket_transfer_119b03a1	pe	Uh, oh...	game/v13/scene7.rpy	220	pe "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_f8e2fe18	u	No, nothing bad! *Laughs* For some reason I really impressed Mr. Lee with the murder thing on the ferry, and he gave me these two tickets as a reward.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	225	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_e4455704	pe	Oh, wow! A concert in Amsterdam... That's so cool, [name], congrats.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	230	pe "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_d620df0f	u	Well, thanks. *Chuckles* But look, I know they've been keeping you busy, but I was hoping you could go with me.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	235	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_8d5ade42	pe	You want me to go? Over everyone else?	game/v13/scene7.rpy	240	pe "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_02155188	u	You deserve to have a good night out.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	245	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_61076259	pe	Things must be looking up for me because Ms. Rose just said the same thing...	game/v13/scene7.rpy	250	pe "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_a404bf73	pe	Her and Mr. Lee agreed to give me a night out whenever I wanted while we're in Amsterdam. So yes, I'll definitely go! Thank you so much for asking me, [name].	game/v13/scene7.rpy	252	pe "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_1509356b	u	Of course. I can't wait for this.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	257	u "[what]"

v13_ticket_transfer_8569c4fa	u	*Chuckles*	game/v13/scene7.rpy	274	u "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_c22ee84f	pe	Well, I don't want them changing their mind after thinking I'm fooling around so, I'll see you later.	game/v13/scene7.rpy	279	pe "[what]"
v13_ticket_transfer_babc0bfd	u	Haha, okay Miss Rule Follower. Go get the job done!	game/v13/scene7.rpy	284	u "[what]"

v13_ticket_transfer_ef985e88	u	I could say the same to you. *Chuckles* I got up for food, you?	game/v13/scene7.rpy	309	u "[what]"

v13s8_53f42f46	u	I'm also not gonna act like I don't like you or have no feelings for you, but I do agree. We shouldn't have done what we did while you're in a relationship.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	132	u "[what]"
v13s8_e91eddb9	u	Nora, you don't have to apologize for anything. You didn't make this decision on your own. I wanted this... I want this.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	140	u "[what]"
v13s8_d5348ec1	u	I understand not believing in cheating, so leave him then. You say that you know he's doing wrong by you, yet you're still wanting to do right by him and it's completely contradicting.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	145	u "[what]"
v13s8_f1b98ea6	no	[name], I-	game/v13/scene8.rpy	150	no "[what]"
v13s8_84def619	u	I mean it when I say this, Nora. I'm not gonna walk around feeling bad for what we did. I didn't do it because I hate Chris, I did it because I really, really like you.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	155	u "[what]"
v13s8_d7ddc0e7	no	*Sighs* This is a lot, [name]. In the moment it felt right but... Now I know for sure that it wasn't.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	160	no "[what]"

v13s8_786be6bc	no	I'm not sure, I really just need time to figure everything out. So for now, can we just act as if nothing happened between us?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	182	no "[what]"
v13s8_b6a62e60	u	I can give you that for right now, but please don't keep me in the dark too much longer.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	187	u "[what]"
v13s8_b9b2cdcd	no	Trust me, I know what it's like wanting someone to communicate. I'll be sure to talk to you about everything as soon as I'm ready.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	192	no "[what]"

v13s8_251935d4	no	I'm sure like everyone else, you want to know how things are between me and Chris?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	203	no "[what]"
v13s8_8fcfb66e	u	Well, I'm more focused on seeing how you are rather than being nosey about your situation.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	208	u "[what]"
v13s8_138dd7f9	no	Ha, right... I forgot. You're the one who actually cares from time to time.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	213	no "[what]"
v13s8_48dae8c7	u	Yep, that's me. Mr. Cares A Lot.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	218	u "[what]"
v13s8_0e7fcf4e	no	Haha, well...	game/v13/scene8.rpy	223	no "[what]"
v13s8_af341ff2	no	Things are in a weird place right now. I don't know how to feel about everything and I'm pretty embarrassed with how things went down the other day.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	228	no "[what]"
v13s8_9b5cbd12	u	You mean in the lobby?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	233	u "[what]"
v13s8_84e883ee	no	Yeah. I just feel like him and I need to have a real heart to heart, but he's acting like nothing happened.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	238	no "[what]"
v13s8_99a12921	u	Does that bother you?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	243	u "[what]"
v13s8_3c1dc752	no	It does and it doesn't. I want to talk about what happened and where we stand, but I'm also enjoying us just being okay.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	248	no "[what]"
v13s8_973f75a6	no	He's not busy as much anymore and he's actually been trying to spend time with me, so it's all conflicting.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	249	no "[what]"
v13s8_ebc18f98	u	That's a real pickle you're in. *Chuckles*	game/v13/scene8.rpy	254	u "[what]"
v13s8_d62ad421	u	Planning on just letting time tell?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	259	u "[what]"
v13s8_e23971f0	no	That's exactly my plan, I think.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	264	no "[what]"
v13s8_f3e86b2f	u	Let's just hope that the ending is a good one.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	269	u "[what]"
v13s8_b8d09ad3	no	I'll be praying for it.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	274	no "[what]"
v13s8_ee52491e	u	Haha, good.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	279	u "[what]"
v13s8_040a7c67	u	Anything changed in the Nora and Chloe story?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	284	u "[what]"
v13s8_4f34f97b	no	Yeah. #LindseyForPresident.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	289	no "[what]"
v13s8_9cde71e4	u	So, you know about that?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	294	u "[what]"
v13s8_16c3ab5b	no	Everyone does, haha. All of the Chicks are secretly deciding who they'll vote for when it all goes down.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	299	no "[what]"
v13s8_29032af3	u	And you're voting for Lindsey?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	304	u "[what]"
v13s8_5b7186e2	no	Wouldn't you?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	309	no "[what]"
v13s8_d8226c0e	u	Yeah, I think I'd have to pick Lindsey at the moment.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	320	u "[what]"
v13s8_f5d997b3	u	I wouldn't go one way or the other just yet.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	327	u "[what]"
v13s8_1ff34b29	no	I have to go for Lindsey, regardless of what I just found out.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	332	no "[what]"

v13s8_53d4357d	no	You probably already know, but the fact that Chloe has to be the President of Chicks in order to keep her Greek scholarship?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	342	no "[what]"
v13s8_0bdc94ad	u	Wait, what? I didn't know that!	game/v13/scene8.rpy	347	u "[what]"
v13s8_86a4aed5	no	I assumed since you guys are close, that you'd know...	game/v13/scene8.rpy	352	no "[what]"
v13s8_e864635d	u	I had no idea... Damn, a scholarship? Why does she have to be President though? She can't just be a member?	game/v13/scene8.rpy	357	u "[what]"
v13s8_ae125356	no	Nope, it's limited to Presidents and if she loses it, she'll have to find another way to pay for next semester.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	362	no "[what]"
v13s8_197911b3	no	I feel bad, but I'm not going to give her a pity vote. If the whole story of her situation got out to everyone then she may get some pity votes, but not from me.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	367	no "[what]"
v13s8_ec428925	u	Wow, that adds a whole other dynamic to this situation.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	372	u "[what]"
v13s8_6685c883	no	Yep, it's crazy how much this Chicks stuff has affected everyone. You wouldn't believe it, but Chloe and I used to be really close.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	377	no "[what]"
v13s8_20ba4975	u	You're right, I wouldn't believe it. *Laughs*	game/v13/scene8.rpy	382	u "[what]"
v13s8_d48389ad	no	Haha, we were! But once we got involved in the Chicks, things changed.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	387	no "[what]"
v13s8_cd8f704d	u	It's like that sometimes. I would've thought it'd only make you guys closer...	game/v13/scene8.rpy	392	u "[what]"
v13s8_4669c0d5	no	It did at first, but then she became President and our disagreements started to show.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	397	no "[what]"
v13s8_c45e583e	u	Yeah, except this time it's not just you with those disagreements. Let's hope everything works out.	game/v13/scene8.rpy	402	u "[what]"

nextsceneo_58eff7c4	lee	I know that some of you have put this class off for multiple years, while others of you are taking it in their first year.	game/v2/v2.rpy	1514	lee "[what]"
nextsceneo_aaf1e329	lee	Even though it is unfathomable to me how you could actively try to avoid the most exciting subject in the world...	game/v2/v2.rpy	1518	lee "[what]"
nextsceneo_cba6747b	lee	I guess there is something to be said about saving the best for last.	game/v2/v2.rpy	1520	lee "[what]"

cx_ad_dd3ef603	au	But, I haven't told anyone about it.	game/v3/v3.rpy	1477	au "[what]"

continueam_39320b34	la	Now it's up to you, will you actively decide to kill the dog to save a human life or will you idly stand by and let her die?	game/v5/v5.rpy	1281	la "[what]"
continueam_6b879436	la	You can decide to switch the lever, but remember, you're on a timer. If you don't switch the lever within a few seconds, the train will keep its current course.	game/v5/v5.rpy	1286	la "[what]"

meetgrayson_8b940739	u	Right...	game/v6/v6.rpy	4649	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_ba0e81c6	gr	You know, growing up. Things weren't always easy.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4655	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_47188771	u	Yeah, I can relate to that.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4661	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_eedf7c7d	gr	Sometimes I just snap. I guess it all comes back to how we grew up.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4667	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_0432d423	u	If you don't mind me asking, how did you grow up?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4673	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_28dd0e60	gr	When I was very young, my mom passed away, so for most of my life it was just me and my dad.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4679	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_2056e805	u	I'm sorry.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4685	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_7e7154d6	gr	It wasn't that bad for a while. Sure I was sad, but I had a great life before. My dad was caring and we had a lot of money so that was never an issue.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4691	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_0ec302d6	u	So what happened?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4697	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_16a4ec71	gr	Well not too long after, my dad remarried. And at first it was fine, like at least my dad was happy.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4703	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_c97dc706	gr	I didn't really get along with my two new stepbrothers, but they weren't terrible people.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4704	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_89657c79	gr	It wasn't until my dad became sick... I mean, it all happened so quickly and all of the sudden... he was gone.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4705	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_b466a1d7	gr	After that step mom just went crazy.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4711	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_b10f67eb	gr	It's like she waited for this to push me out of the family. She'd force me to sleep in the attic and I had to do all the chores. I was treated like a maid.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4717	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_a32f21f6	gr	And my step brothers taunted and bullied me. The once amazing house I lived in had fallen apart because my evil stepmother began spending all of my dad's money.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4718	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_23a48cec	gr	It was really terrible. I was never allowed to make friends or have fun. I lived just to serve them.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4719	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_31b816c5	u	Man, I'm sorry. That's really terrible. I didn't know you had it so rough.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4729	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_c0c562f0	gr	Yeah, sometimes stuff like that just leads to anger management issues.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4735	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_3e49d661	u	I get it. We're cool.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4741	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_2145baea	gr	Good. We're here by the way.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4747	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_797010c1	u	That story sure sounds an awful lot like Cinderella.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4752	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_2002ab68	gr	*Laughs* You got me.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4758	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_ef2f1671	u	What?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4764	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_3847538c	gr	It was a test.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4770	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_c08124eb	u	A test?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4776	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_e4aed42c	gr	Yeah, just to see how naive you were. To be an Ape you gotta be sharp. We need top guys.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4782	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_01dbe0fb	gr	Not a lot of people would've caught that.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4783	gr "[what]"
meetgrayson_8b940739_1	u	Right...	game/v6/v6.rpy	4789	u "[what]"
meetgrayson_4489cc69	gr	We're here.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4795	gr "[what]"
wehere_5b92abc2	gr	What does it mean to be a winner?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4803	gr "[what]"
wehere_c13a46d4	gr	A winner is relentless. Some would even say ruthless. A tough guy. A guy who will stick it out until the end to make sure, that he's the one coming out on top.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4813	gr "[what]"
wehere_5dbc255b	gr	A winner doesn't let anyone surpass him. He won't tolerate anyone who gets in his way. He does whatever it takes to win.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4814	gr "[what]"
wehere_87767ff4	gr	So in other words, a winner is an Ape. An Ape doesn't let any fucker step on him. An Ape isn't a pussy.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4819	gr "[what]"
wehere_3fcc46a3	gr	He stands up for himself and his guys and fights it out. We're some of the strongest and smartest guys around.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4824	gr "[what]"
wehere_faf5e393	gr	[name], I look at you and I see the potential.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4829	gr "[what]"
wehere_dce8ec1c	gr	The potential to become the next great Ape. To become a winner. To become a leader.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4830	gr "[what]"
wehere_8134e4bb	gr	Join the Apes. Join me. Together, we'll destroy the Wolves. We'll destroy anyone who gets in our way.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4831	gr "[what]"
wehere_4a72fcf0	gr	And the best part, all the girls come flocking. I know you have your eye on Chloe. She won't be able to resist you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4836	gr "[what]"
wehere_41e5043e	u	How do you see potential, when you don't even know me?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4843	u "[what]"
wehere_cfe8d72f	u	I haven't even fought anyone!	game/v6/v6.rpy	4846	u "[what]"
wehere_9a810d24	gr	You can teach someone how to fight, but you can't teach them how to think.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4851	gr "[what]"
wehere_0dd25d76	u	I fought like one guy in my entire life!	game/v6/v6.rpy	4854	u "[what]"
wehere_9a810d24_1	gr	You can teach someone how to fight, but you can't teach them how to think.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4859	gr "[what]"
wehere_acbc962b	u	I fought like two people in my entire life!	game/v6/v6.rpy	4862	u "[what]"
wehere_ddfdf0b9	gr	You can teach someone how to fight, you can't teach them how to think.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4867	gr "[what]"
wehere_c512aa3b	gr	You may not be a big fighter yet, but we can change that in no time with our facilities.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4869	gr "[what]"
wehere_34f5fe90	gr	What I see in front of me is much more than a fighter, I see a leader.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4870	gr "[what]"
wehere_e6f058f0	gr	People are drawn to you. Don't let that go to waste with a frat that doesn't see your true potential.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4871	gr "[what]"
wehere_8fbaa728	gr	Join the Apes and I promise you, everyone at San Vallejo will know who you are within weeks.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4872	gr "[what]"
wehere_3de68741	gr	So what do you say?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4877	gr "[what]"
wehere_49a9e742	u	Uhm...	game/v6/v6.rpy	4882	u "[what]"
wehere_b331919a	imre	Exactly, which is also why I'm joining the Wolves.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4889	imre "[what]"
wehere_a2226aec	u	The Wolves? I thought the Apes were the best frat to get girls?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4894	u "[what]"
wehere_b001c4ba	imre	Who told you that?! That's bullshit.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4899	imre "[what]"
wehere_20d8a0c5	imre	The Apes are disloyal pieces of shit. The Wolves are real brothers and they get mad pussy.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4900	imre "[what]"
wehere_d8ab5241	u	Didn't you say it's your first day? How do you know the frats so well?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4905	u "[what]"
wehere_b938dede	imre	It is, but my brother used to be a Wolf and he told me about all the shady shit that the Apes would do.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4910	imre "[what]"
wehere_41f7fb45	u	Okay, I'm in.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4922	u "[what]"
wehere_db2ed90b	gr	That's what I'm talking about!	game/v6/v6.rpy	4930	gr "[what]"
wehere_8712550d	gr	You made the right call.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4940	gr "[what]"

wehere_dd4ba356	gr	Trust me.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4950	gr "[what]"
wehere_351a4e55	gr	Just remember, once an Ape, always an Ape. Otherwise we're gonna have to kill you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4951	gr "[what]"
wehere_106f7a82	u	What???	game/v6/v6.rpy	4956	u "[what]"
wehere_5035cacb	gr	*Laughs* I'm just messing with you. Come on, let's go.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4961	gr "[what]"
wehere_b52f166f	u	I told people I was gonna go to the Wolves' rush party, but I probably shouldn't go now, right?	game/v6/v6.rpy	4971	u "[what]"
wehere_92d563ab	gr	Nah, you should go.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4977	gr "[what]"
wehere_01fb1865	gr	Sometimes I like to hang out with less talented people too... just to see how the other side lives.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4983	gr "[what]"
wehere_0129843b	u	*Chuckles* Alright, I'll go.	game/v6/v6.rpy	4989	u "[what]"

afterpsb_ef74cd56	u	*Laughs* So what happened?	game/v6/v6.rpy	6473	u "[what]"
afterpsb_ee0d6c1f	pe	At some point he started accusing me of cheating and he kicked me out.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6478	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_beb7e86a	pe	He never wanted anything to do with me after that.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6480	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_4915f6f6	pe	So now, I make sure that when I'm on a date, the guy wins every game.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6482	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_7e772c6e	u	Okay, that's a nice story, but I don't buy it.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6487	u "[what]"
afterpsb_a745c1b0	u	You're telling me if you tried to win you'd just beat me easily? No way.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6489	u "[what]"
afterpsb_8abcc8a8	pe	Are you sure?	game/v6/v6.rpy	6499	pe "[what]"

afterpsb_a1000fee	pe	Heehee. I guess I was telling the truth.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6526	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_1e5bd9c2	u	You're full of surprises, you know?	game/v6/v6.rpy	6531	u "[what]"
afterpsb_3404d69d	u	Talking about surprises, are you ever gonna tell me what you got kicked out of your old college for?	game/v6/v6.rpy	6538	u "[what]"
afterpsb_b174a144	pe	Okay. But you can't tell anyone.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6548	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_1b28a406	u	Of course.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6553	u "[what]"
afterpsb_50157d8c	pe	Uhm.. okay so I... I hacked into the school's system and changed some of the grades.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6558	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_ae2150c9	u	Wait you hacked into your school to improve your grades? Come on that's hilarious.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6563	u "[what]"
afterpsb_7cdbe8b8	pe	Not my grades. My best friend Jenny's.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6568	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_f4d0cf5c	pe	She was going through a rough time, dealing with some substance abuse, and therefore, didn't hand in some of her assignments on time...	game/v6/v6.rpy	6570	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_15f29d63	pe	Her teacher was gonna fail her.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6572	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_977b5077	pe	So she begged me to help her and I... I changed her grade so she'd pass.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6574	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_bc79a438	u	Why didn't you just tell me? That's honestly so awesome that you did that for your friend.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6579	u "[what]"
afterpsb_4ad9cc4e	pe	Because that's not what I got kicked out for.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6584	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_39d502ac	pe	When they found out what happened, Jenny came forward and said she did it all by herself.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6586	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_d6837971	pe	She told me I shouldn't pay the price for her mistakes.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6587	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_374ffa45	pe	But then, after she got kicked out, the principal started making her the face of the college's anti substance abuse campaign.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6592	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_c141532c	pe	Without even asking her... how could they do that?	game/v6/v6.rpy	6594	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_5c2f0b5d	pe	So... I decided the hack into the college's website and photoshopped the principal's face onto all of the substance abuse pictures they used.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6596	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_f8b678d0	pe	*Takes a deep breath*	game/v6/v6.rpy	6601	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_c821d38e	pe	Turns out the principal had nothing to do with Jenny's pictures being used... it was her parents' idea.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6606	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_bfc576d0	pe	They didn't want what happened to her to happen to anyone else.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6608	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_467c3f1f	pe	So I came forward and got expelled.	game/v6/v6.rpy	6610	pe "[what]"
afterpsb_21460949	u	Oh god, Penelope... I had no idea...	game/v6/v6.rpy	6615	u "[what]"
afterpsb_fe088f5c	pe	Can we please just stop talking about it?	game/v6/v6.rpy	6620	pe "[what]"

v6_fr3chris1_61394ae9	u	Yeah, but it was really a one time thing. I don't really know much about fighting.	game/v6/v6.rpy	8017	u "[what]"
v6_fr3chris1_e77b423f	ch	That just proves even more how much talent you have.	game/v6/v6.rpy	8022	ch "[what]"

v6_fr3chris1_5fbe7379	u	Yeah, it does seem like it.	game/v6/v6.rpy	8115	u "[what]"

upstairsaubrey_a4acbf5c_1	u	(Damn...)	game/v6/v6.rpy	10197	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_3c026204_2	u	(I should probably talk to Chris soon.)	game/v6/v6.rpy	10199	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_53457f7c	u	At least we got to talk a bit, haha.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10204	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_fd5200d5	au	Yeah, it was nice. I'll see you back downstairs.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10209	au "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_3c026204_3	u	(I should probably talk to Chris soon.)	game/v6/v6.rpy	10214	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_b17b9166	u	I mean, I kinda get what he means... I wouldn't wanna share my girlfriend with anyone else.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10224	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_7c1902e5	u	Even if it's a girl.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10229	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_1304d905	au	Really? I thought you'd be a little more open to this kinda stuff...	game/v6/v6.rpy	10234	au "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_20772f5b	u	I don't know. I'm just saying I see where he's coming from.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10239	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_a808de94	au	Right...	game/v6/v6.rpy	10244	au "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_5add534b	au	Anyways, I should probably go downstairs again. Emily's probably missing me.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10246	au "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_f78452e2	u	Oh, already?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10251	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_5b808863	au	Yeah... I'll see you later.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10256	au "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_4866ebb4	u	(I feel like I said something wrong there...)	game/v6/v6.rpy	10261	u "[what]"
upstairsaubrey_c0f8c49b	u	(I should probably talk to Chris soon anyway.)	game/v6/v6.rpy	10263	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_9234bcaa	em	So why'd you choose this office?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10272	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_d68a50df	u	*Chuckles* What do you mean?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10277	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_c5327244	em	It's not the most comfortable place to-	game/v6/v6.rpy	10282	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_33106ee9	u	*Laughs* Woah, slow down. I just wanted to hang out with you a bit.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10287	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_462268ef	em	Just missed you is all?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10292	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_cd27e96e	em	Soo, actually I was thinking the next we...	game/v6/v6.rpy	10294	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_454642ef	em	You know...	game/v6/v6.rpy	10296	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_9cb65bf9	em	I wanna try anal.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10301	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_7f9fe18c	u	*Laughs* What? Anal? Seriously?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10306	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_dc4a3467	u	I swear you told me you never ever wanted to do it in your entire life back when we were dating.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10308	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_1d19236a	em	Well that's what I thought at the time...	game/v6/v6.rpy	10313	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_a8191202	em	But when we broke up, I got lonely... and horny.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10315	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_71bb5b91	em	So I started looking up porn, you know, just once or twice...	game/v6/v6.rpy	10317	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_8690b33d	em	And anal kinda really turned me on.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10319	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_8a09c8d2	u	I mean yeah, let's do it. Hahaha.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10324	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_16e0fbb7	u	I'm not gonna say no to that.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10326	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_be360d04	em	Good. But we have to start slow. Maybe just a finger or two at first. And a lot of lube.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10331	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_9ce644c2	u	Yeah, of course. We'll make sure you're comfortable and it doesn't hurt at all.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10336	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_be4437d7	em	Thank you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10341	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_8fed06a8	em	I should probably go back downstairs now.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10343	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_69ab7b71	u	*Chuckles* Really? You're gonna put this image in my head and then just leave me like this.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10348	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_c218844a	em	Sorry, but Aubrey is probably waiting for me and I'm not looking to take penalty shots for leaving her... I'm tipsy enough as it is.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10353	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_194f4de3	u	Alright, I get it. I should probably talk to Chris anyways.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10358	u "[what]"
upstairsemily_df62db15	em	Good luck with that.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10363	em "[what]"
upstairsemily_bf32046c	em	I'll see you later.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10375	em "[what]"
upstairsamber_e00fb967	am	So you pull me away from all shirtless guys working out to bring me in here?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10384	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_7d581a82	u	Yup. Welcome to the most interesting part of the party, the office.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10389	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_062451b5	am	I can barely hold my excitement in.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10394	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_c5463390	u	*Chuckles* And yet you manage.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10399	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_a689efb4	u	Just thought it would be nice to be somewhere a bit more quiet for a bit.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10401	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_35c7cd6f	am	Uhm... sure.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10406	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_4383871c	u	Did you ever hook up with Josh?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10411	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_9ea74d50	am	*Laughs* Wow, that's out of the blue. No, I have not. I mean he used to hit on me quite a bit, but he's not my type. And now he's moved on to Kim.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10416	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_828091c1	u	Sorry, I was just curious.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10421	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_371bc47d	am	Here's a tip, if you're trying to get into someone's pants, don't talk to her about whether she's hooking up with other guys.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10426	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_fa4f9fca	u	Who say's I'm trying to get into your pants?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10431	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_f1f2656b	am	Isn't it obvious? Dark, lonely office. Just me and you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10436	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_5cab7447	am	There's even a couch here.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10438	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_8038d7d2	u	Haha. Maybe. But maybe I just wanted to talk to you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10443	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_de85fbd9	am	And what's there to talk about?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10448	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_03a4a5cb	u	For example, why weren't you hanging out with Josh and Kim tonight? Why stay alone all night?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10453	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_1787c0ee	am	I found something more interesting, haha. I'm not that deep. They were just getting high all night and I wasn't feeling the vibe.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10458	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_803a5def	u	Are you feeling this vibe?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10463	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_1a38103b	am	Maybe.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10468	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_98699435		*Amber's phone rings*	game/v6/v6.rpy	10475	"[what]"
upstairsamber_3d21fdfb	am	Hold up.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10480	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_3b8dfe30	am	Hello?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10487	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_bb91a7df	am	Oh no, really? Okay I'll come down.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10497	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_b33920a3	am	Sorry, Kim's throwing up, I gotta go hold her hair.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10502	am "[what]"
upstairsamber_8cdd3120	u	Oh shit. Uhm... I'll see you later then.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10507	u "[what]"
upstairsamber_c4cc8676	am	Okay, yeah. See you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10512	am "[what]"
upstairsriley_d68fc77a	ri	This was a good idea.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10522	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_0b6a4ea5	u	Coming up here?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10527	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_df57843e	ri	Yeah, it's nice to be somewhere a bit more quiet after being right next to really loud speakers the entire night.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10532	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_7b6f33f1	u	Yeah, I guess my ideas are pretty brilliant, aren't they?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10537	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_1f4010b1	ri	*Chuckles* Don't get ahead of yourself, buddy.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10542	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_11e00b49	u	It's hard when you're this dazzling.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10547	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_16468adc	ri	*Laughs* So have you decided if you're going to join the Wolves or not?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10552	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_96a94254	u	Actually, I'm probably gonna join the Apes.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10558	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_d7c5ca95	ri	The Apes?! Didn't Grayson punch you?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10563	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_09760ad6	u	Yeah, but he apologized and he really sees my potential, you know.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10568	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_f06bdd8d	ri	Your potential?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10573	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_5267d27a	u	Yeah, he says I could be one of the greats, leading the Apes.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10578	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_7c128d03	ri	[name], are you sure about this? Didn't you say you don't like fighting?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10583	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_125978fe	ri	Also, I don't wanna be mean, but... you're not really a proven quality, don't you find it weird that he puts so much faith in you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10585	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_a8cb4846	u	What are you trying to say?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10590	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_45ceef98	ri	I don't know... maybe he's manipulating you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10595	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_861c80f6	u	He's not, okay? You weren't there. He sees in me what no one else seems to see.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10600	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_6ecf6b47	ri	I see stuff in you. [name], you're not like anyone I've ever met.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10605	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_bf781286	ri	But that doesn't mean that Grayson isn't taking advantage of you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10607	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_b9844c10	u	I don't really wanna talk about it anymore.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10612	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_31411ab0	ri	Okay... I'll go back downstairs then. I'll see you later.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10617	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_b8911521	u	Alright.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10622	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_69f26898	u	I'm not sure yet, but I'm leaning towards joining them.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10625	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_cbab25eb	ri	I think you'd make a great Wolf.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10630	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_ee01f9b9	u	Thanks.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10635	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_662b39ac	u	You talk to Ryan lately?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10637	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_53bd8a31	ri	Ryan? Honestly, he kind of annoys me sometimes. I know he has no ill intentions, but he can be bit of a horn dog.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10642	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_8e383e5b	u	*Laughs* What'd he do?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10647	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_edda7c10	ri	Nothing really.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10652	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_df526987	ri	Actually you can't tell anyone but last night, Ryan booty called me. He seemed very drunk... I don't know why.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10654	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_07327e2a	u	*Laughs* So what'd you do?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10659	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_acda9b06	ri	*Chuckles* What do you mean what'd I do? I told him no and that he should drink water and get some rest.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10664	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_af302b33	u	Ouch.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10669	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_e3cb891d	ri	I feel kinda bad for him, maybe he was just lonely.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10674	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_d943192f	u	I think he'll be fine. He was just a horny guy thinking you're an easy lay.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10679	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_0e76864e	ri	Well I'm not.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10684	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_4b9ed441	u	*Chuckles* Apparently.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10689	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_cc07ac18	ri	I should probably go back downstairs before Finn also booty calls me.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10694	ri "[what]"
upstairsriley_5c51ccf7	u	*Laughs* Oh god. I should probably talk to Chris soon anyway.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10699	u "[what]"
upstairsriley_7cda5cd3	ri	Good luck. I'll see you later.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10704	ri "[what]"
v6_fr3chris3_4902cea4	ch	You ready?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10712	ch "[what]"
v6_fr3chris3_c4c7239f	u	Yeah. So what did you wanna show me?	game/v6/v6.rpy	10717	u "[what]"
v6_fr3chris3_efcf4581	ch	Follow me.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10722	ch "[what]"
v6_fr3chris3_087f0d60	ch	I don't usually show this to outsiders, but I have a good feeling about you.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10732	ch "[what]"
v6_fr3chris3_8b831e6a	u	Holy shit.	game/v6/v6.rpy	10746	u "[what]"
v7start_6db60d7a	u	This is amazing.	game/v7/v7.rpy	38	u "[what]"
v7start_d8491119	ch	These are all the fight kings of the Wolves. There's one for every year we have won.	game/v7/v7.rpy	45	ch "[what]"
v7start_e7fdb905	u	Haven't you guys won seven times though? I only count six portraits.	game/v7/v7.rpy	50	u "[what]"
v7start_4fa1efe5	ch	Yeah, well that's because of this guy.	game/v7/v7.rpy	55	ch "[what]"
v7start_a7e817e4	ch	This is a Wolves legend right here, Bence Varga.	game/v7/v7.rpy	60	ch "[what]"
v7start_fed7f2e4	u	Imre's brother...	game/v7/v7.rpy	62	u "[what]"
v7start_42705392	ch	He won two years in a row. The only Wolf to ever win twice.	game/v7/v7.rpy	64	ch "[what]"
v7start_cdb1c36c	ch	You should've seen him. He was so determined. Sometimes he'd workout for eight hours in a single day.	game/v7/v7.rpy	69	ch "[what]"
v7start_a1cf6498	u	That's insane.	game/v7/v7.rpy	74	u "[what]"
v7start_f399348a	ch	Yeah, he was something different.	game/v7/v7.rpy	79	ch "[what]"
v7start_5281058e	u	Who's the guy next to him?	game/v7/v7.rpy	84	u "[what]"
v7start_dff9d72c	ch	*Chuckles* Oh that guy. That's Chuck. AKA the fighting cock.	game/v7/v7.rpy	89	ch "[what]"
v7start_c2c7166c	u	The fighting cock? Like a-?	game/v7/v7.rpy	91	u "[what]"
v7start_a96b2544	ch	Haha, no not like that. Like a chicken. Cock just sounded better.	game/v7/v7.rpy	96	ch "[what]"
v7start_2bc37cea	ch	He was scrawny as fuck, but that kid could fight like hell.	game/v7/v7.rpy	98	ch "[what]"
v7start_9a0e7144	u	Haha, damn.	game/v7/v7.rpy	103	u "[what]"
v7start_77066e7a	ch	And then next to him is Drew. He was known for his kicks.	game/v7/v7.rpy	108	ch "[what]"
v7start_3d5c67e2	ch	I don't remember what that guy used to do, I think it was gymnastics or something. I don't know him personally, but we still teach his kicking technique to this day.	game/v7/v7.rpy	113	ch "[what]"
v7start_8c152cf6	u	I didn't know gymnastics would make you good at fighting.	game/v7/v7.rpy	115	u "[what]"
v7start_62edcde3	ch	Haha, me neither. But here at the Wolves, we try not to judge people based on stereotypes.	game/v7/v7.rpy	120	ch "[what]"
v7start_fd68924d	ch	He actually got turned away by the Apes that year. They told him he didn't fit the style.	game/v7/v7.rpy	125	ch "[what]"
v7start_8c6ca059	ch	But the Wolves saw his potential and welcomed him with open arms. He turned out be one of the best fighters we ever had.	game/v7/v7.rpy	127	ch "[what]"
v7start_1b70ca7d	u	Yeah, sounds amazing.	game/v7/v7.rpy	132	u "[what]"
v7start_d7d26b64	u	What about the guys on the other side?	game/v7/v7.rpy	134	u "[what]"
v7start_e75fead3	ch	On the left that's David Park. He was actually a foreign exchange student from Korea quite a while ago.	game/v7/v7.rpy	139	ch "[what]"
v7start_2aa6bcf0	ch	He was a black belt in Taekwondo. It took him a little while to adjust to a different style of combat, but his fighting was like an art. He was swift, light on his feet.	game/v7/v7.rpy	141	ch "[what]"
v7start_108d8f94	u	How do you know so much about each of them? You've only been at San Vallejo for like three years, right? 	game/v7/v7.rpy	146	u "[what]"
v7start_beedabb8	ch	These guys are legends. There were hundreds of Wolves over the years, only six ever won the Summer Showdown. It's a huge deal, so you hear a lot about them.	game/v7/v7.rpy	151	ch "[what]"
v7start_87c8c59c	u	Yeah, I guess that makes sense.	game/v7/v7.rpy	156	u "[what]"
v7start_cca7cd58	u	What about him?	game/v7/v7.rpy	161	u "[what]"
v7start_871551c9	ch	That's the wall.	game/v7/v7.rpy	163	ch "[what]"
v7start_7128fac3	u	The wall?	game/v7/v7.rpy	165	u "[what]"
v7start_ccae0443	ch	He was a big guy. He wasn't particularly skilled at fighting from what I've heard. He was hella slow.	game/v7/v7.rpy	170	ch "[what]"
v7start_420b5c5d	u	Then how the hell did he become Fight King?	game/v7/v7.rpy	175	u "[what]"
v7start_9e7c062d	ch	Because that guy could take hits like it was nothing, hence the wall.	game/v7/v7.rpy	180	ch "[what]"
v7start_9235aeab	ch	He'd just let the other guy hit him over and over again until they got tired. Then when the other guy was completely exhausted, the wall would just lay one good hit on him and he'd be down.	game/v7/v7.rpy	182	ch "[what]"
v7start_1266e179	u	That's crazy. That guy must have had some mad genetics.	game/v7/v7.rpy	187	u "[what]"
v7start_1ab4d2cf	ch	Yeah he was just completely unbreakable.	game/v7/v7.rpy	192	ch "[what]"
v7start_831481ac	u	Okay, what about the last guy? He can't possibly be a Fight King, right?	game/v7/v7.rpy	197	u "[what]"
v7start_c3845f42	ch	I told you, we don't discriminate based on prejudices. That's Earl Levington. He was a brain, probably the smartest Wolf we ever had.	game/v7/v7.rpy	199	ch "[what]"
v7start_10e84c19	ch	He would plan out his moves methodically. He would analyze the way his opponents fought and prepare every possible move.	game/v7/v7.rpy	201	ch "[what]"
v7start_ce8dfd97	ch	I mean he barely got hit. He dodged almost every punch thrown at him based on his opponents' micro expressions.	game/v7/v7.rpy	206	ch "[what]"
v7start_9c3f3e11	u	Now that's actually insane.	game/v7/v7.rpy	211	u "[what]"
v7start_339482d4	u	So all these guys were Wolves Presidents too?	game/v7/v7.rpy	213	u "[what]"
v7start_a92a95f7	ch	Yup. Each and every one of them was at some point in their lives.	game/v7/v7.rpy	218	ch "[what]"
v7start_6cc90eff	u	So, I don't know if it's weird asking, but if you're not one of the Fight Kings, how come you're the current President?	game/v7/v7.rpy	228	u "[what]"
v7start_d6df20e4	ch	Well the year before me, Chuck was President. It was his last year, so I got voted in.	game/v7/v7.rpy	233	ch "[what]"
v7start_731b052f	ch	We need a new President every one or two years so some Presidents aren't Fight Kings.	game/v7/v7.rpy	235	ch "[what]"

v7start_fa028502	ch	But I also believe that being President whilst someone else wins for the Wolves is just as big of an honor as winning yourself.	game/v7/v7.rpy	239	ch "[what]"
v7start_45c1ffc8	ch	A good leader doesn't need to be the best fighter.	game/v7/v7.rpy	241	ch "[what]"
v7start_74da2cc0	u	Yeah, I can see that. But winning must be surreal too.	game/v7/v7.rpy	246	u "[what]"

hg_ad_24bd972a	ch	You gotta manifest your beliefs. Only way to make 'em come true.	game/v7/v7.rpy	264	ch "[what]"
hg_ad_75d05756	ch	I bought the frame preemptively because I know that this will be our year.	game/v7/v7.rpy	269	ch "[what]"
hg_ad_891f2c97	u	Well it's good you're prepared.	game/v7/v7.rpy	274	u "[what]"

beachlauren_d59a86bf	u	Look Lauren, I know you're not big on fighting, but being in a frat is so much more. And I just really think I'd miss out on a lot if I didn't join one.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2825	u "[what]"
beachlauren_61dbb461	la	Yeah, you'd miss out on all the girls who love fighters...	game/v7/v7.rpy	2830	la "[what]"
beachlauren_3d4ff4bd	u	Lauren, it's not that, come on. It's about the brotherhood and learning from each other and growing as a person.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2835	u "[what]"
beachlauren_073a3fb8	la	I just don't want you to get hurt.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2840	la "[what]"

beachlauren_b4db03b1	u	What's wrong with the Apes?	game/v7/v7.rpy	2866	u "[what]"
beachlauren_815cec29	la	They're obnoxious, arrogant and they don't even have the brotherhood you said you cared about.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2871	la "[what]"
beachlauren_2e8f985c	la	My sister told me a bunch about what they're like and I wouldn't want you to be one of them.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2873	la "[what]"
beachlauren_b7fec015	u	C'mon I'll still be me. Are you saying you'd break this off if I join the Apes?	game/v7/v7.rpy	2878	u "[what]"
beachlauren_a5ad2742	la	No [name]... but if you're already joining a frat, why not at least one that doesn't reek of toxic masculinity?	game/v7/v7.rpy	2883	la "[what]"
beachlauren_75214e48	u	I'll give it some more thought... but I need you to know that I'm pretty set on it and you might not like my final decision.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2888	u "[what]"

beachlauren_21ef4b8f	u	Yeah, pretty sure.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2916	u "[what]"
beachlauren_6a19a882	la	It's just kinda unfortunate, because if you're joining a frat we won't have as much time for stuff like this.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2921	la "[what]"
beachlauren_a99d2df9	u	*Chuckles* Woah, Lauren...	game/v7/v7.rpy	2926	u "[what]"

beachlauren_b6d31b11	la	Yeah, I mean I know most of them really well and obviously my sister's the President so it's a pretty easy decision.	game/v7/v7.rpy	2998	la "[what]"
beachlauren_31cc0265	u	I guess that's true, well good luck anyway.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3003	u "[what]"

pledgewolves_04594c4d	ch	To be a Wolf you need to be hardworking, persistent, determined.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3645	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_dcd48f21	ch	You need to be deliberate with your actions, confident, dedicated, motivated, and-	game/v7/v7.rpy	3649	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_0a0fa4ed	ch	And fearless!	game/v7/v7.rpy	3653	ch "[what]"

pledgewolves_fd126e58	ch	But most importantly...	game/v7/v7.rpy	3666	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_4c0c2cf5	ch	...I need winners. Being a winner doesn't mean you always have to win.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3670	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_1650ae2f	ch	It means going in there believing that you will win. It's a mindset.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3671	ch "[what]"

pledgewolves_94ea2419	ch	The challenges will be difficult, but if you wanna be a Wolf, you must prove yourself.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3695	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_acae5b7b	ch	Now let's get started with the first challenge.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3696	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_8eb13cdf	ch	Determination. For this challenge you'll have to prove that you will do whatever it takes to become a Wolf. Each of you will be in a separate room.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3704	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_b006ec14	ch	You will be given tasks to test how much you really want to be a Wolf, how far you're willing to go, and what you're willing to give up.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3705	ch "[what]"
pledgewolves_7fcdf632	ch	Other wolves will guide you with the tasks. Let's get started.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3706	ch "[what]"

pledgewolves_8d050bdb	guyc	So, listen. I'm supposed to run you through a bunch of questions and then hit you with the final one in order to see if you're determined enough.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3726	guyc "[what]"
pledgewolves_0668f605	guyc	But I'm just gonna tell you straight up, the only way to show determination is if you're willing to eliminate one of the other guys.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3728	guyc "[what]"
pledgewolves_09332657	u	What do you mean?	game/v7/v7.rpy	3732	u "[what]"
pledgewolves_5775be83	guyc	If I tell the guys you're willing to have me eliminate Imre, I can convince them to secure you a spot. You wouldn't have to compete with the others for it.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3736	guyc "[what]"
pledgewolves_e825940f	u	...And if I don't?	game/v7/v7.rpy	3740	u "[what]"
pledgewolves_894e784c	guyc	Then you'll still continue on with the challenges to try and secure your place.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3744	guyc "[what]"
pledgewolves_ea57ef27	guyc	But remember, we only take in three pledges. And usually at least two people take these deals and get a secure spot. So you might get eliminated if you don't do it.	game/v7/v7.rpy	3745	guyc "[what]"
pledgewolves_fdc18d6b	u	Why Imre?	game/v7/v7.rpy	3749	u "[what]"

prot_w_au_dbebb2fe	aut	Ready?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	69	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_2be5d203	u	Yeah, of course.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	85	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_7347b600	u	We won't stop, until it's fair. We won't stop until it's fair.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	95	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_8d194a53	aut	So you have done this before?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	100	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_a71039af	u	Yeah, of course. That's how you get the word out.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	105	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_9eb32fda	aut	Do you protest a lot?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	110	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_8f6285f1	u	When I can. As much as I can I mean.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	115	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_3468a7ad	aut	That's good. It's nice to know people who are knowledgeable in politics and the issues we still face in society everyday.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	120	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_wing_2950cb76	u	Like I said, we won't stop until it's fair.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	125	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_372f9958	u	Uhh... so it's been a while for me. How does this work again?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	131	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_4a0a5279	aut	Haha that's okay. Is this your first time?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	136	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_f8964793	u	No, no I--	game/v8/scene8.rpy	141	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_cff7cd1f	aut	It's okay. We're just here to make our voices heard, that's all.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	146	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_68e6d6b9	aut	And really you just say whatever you like, as long as it has a purpose. Haha. Watch. We won't stop until we're heard!	game/v8/scene8.rpy	157	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_2ea7efe6	aut	See? Really not much to it.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	162	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_6523ea89	u	Yeah. Haha. I should've known.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	167	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_6a8d8e35	aut	It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but always remember why we're here.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	172	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_wing_ee01f9b9	u	Thanks.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	177	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_1_ed6845fc	aut	Have you heard about the new legislation being proposed on abortions?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	186	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_8994a80e	u	Yeah, pretty insane if you ask me. Abortion, such a horrible thing.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	200	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_2fcffc84	aut	You're against abortion?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	205	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_0269aa96	u	Uhh-- I mean--	game/v8/scene8.rpy	210	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_4ff359f0	aut	You mean you meant you're against the anti-abortion legislation.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	215	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_7a92024b	u	Yeah, that's what I meant.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	220	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_60fb5ea1	aut	It's crazy that government officials, especially considering that they're all mostly men, think they can have a say in what a woman does with their body.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	225	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_ed47f845	u	Fucked up.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	230	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_0709ae20	aut	And that's why we're here right? To tell them that our bodies are our choice. We can't keep letting men think they have the say over everything.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	239	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_7d6505df	u	Yeah. It's all about equality. You're right. Woman weren't made to serve men. We're all our own people.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	244	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_fa975d3c	aut	Exactly! Glad you understand. Like I said before, really nice knowing guys who have a say in the woman's rights movement. It's not often you find guys who are willing to stand by woman and fight with them.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	249	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_651eafeb	u	And that's how you create a movement. One by one until everyone's on board.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	254	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_leg_d3fae4a6	aut	Yeah.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	259	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_leg_e9bebfc4	u	Honestly, I have no idea.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	264	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_leg_f061d589	aut	Oh, so you haven't heard?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	269	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_leg_306c661f	u	Yeah I guess I just had a lot going on lately. I wasn't able to keep up with the news as much.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	274	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_leg_d738dcf6	aut	Well I can fill you in... It's disgusting. A bunch of misogynistic men and political officials introduced legislation to try and make abortions illegal.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	279	aut "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_leg_c8b9a272	u	They can do that?	game/v8/scene8.rpy	284	u "[what]"
prot_w_au_no_leg_800620f0	aut	Not if we have a say. The issue is in the conservative states. They're typically religious and lean towards things like that. But I say, a man should never have a say over a woman's body.	game/v8/scene8.rpy	289	aut "[what]"

v9_warehouse_josh_d1eeaa09	jo	Yeah, it was kind of odd. Chris and Grayson came over to my place and asked if I'd do it. For some reason they thought I'd be good for it. I remember them using the word "entertaining".	game/v9/scene43.rpy	47	jo "[what]"
v9_warehouse_josh_e5537ace	u	We know they're right about that! Got a fancy announcer voice whipped up already? I'm sure you were up all night practicing it in the mirror.	game/v9/scene43.rpy	52	u "[what]"

v9_warehouse_lindsey_6f7acb17	u	You have no idea.	game/v9/scene44.rpy	310	u "[what]"
v9_warehouse_lindsey_41497dd1	u	Can we catch up after the fight?	game/v9/scene44.rpy	312	u "[what]"
v9_warehouse_lindsey_da23bbd6	li	Guess that depends on what shape you're in after the fight.	game/v9/scene44.rpy	317	li "[what]"
v9_warehouse_lindsey_9484cdb7	u	Haha. Yeah, guess I won't be much fun if I get my ass kicked.	game/v9/scene44.rpy	322	u "[what]"

v9_warehouse_lindsey_03fff1d6	u	Sure. Sure. I, uh, have to get back to...worrying. Haha.	game/v9/scene44.rpy	342	u "[what]"

v9_warehouse_lindsey_d9ad25ca	u	(Focus.)	game/v9/scene44.rpy	367	u "[what]"
v9_ending_cc61b844	u	(What the fuck is going on!?)	game/v9/scene45.rpy	17	u "[what]"
v9_ending_fd36c994	u	(Awww shit!)	game/v9/scene45.rpy	34	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_3b09e5fa	u	Enjoying the view?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	34	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_dec8d92e	ry	That obvious, huh?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	39	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_a2337515	u	It's that grin that gives it away, hah.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	44	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_cc77f57d	ry	Can't help it, man. College life, I mean. It's like burning of hotness!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	49	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_b2dc1556	u	Yes, I've noticed.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	54	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_4811f63d	ry	Ever since it started, it's been kinda hard to grasp it all, but how could one not?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	59	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_5141110b	ry	Throw all the pussy you can my way, and I'll handle it no problem, haha.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	60	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_a89a262e	ry	Being in a frat surely does not make it any harder!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	61	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_a2a93119	u	And to me, getting into Wolves really feels like a pretty good choice.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	68	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_b7a5bce3	ry	Oh, here we go, boy. Apes are the way to go, and never look back.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	73	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_89ecfb68	ry	But at least you did get a piece of my philosophy. Frat guys always have better chances with the ladies.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	78	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_44a35439	u	I guess you are right. But there's also something else I've learned.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	83	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_f4638a95	ry	And what is that?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	88	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_3ab5d78a	u	Frat choice does not matter when it comes to being friends, ape boy.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	93	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_dd6510e9	ry	Oh is that so, little puppy?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	98	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_e2212c7d	ry	Still, a poor choice by you, I can tell you that, ha.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	100	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_5839eb58	u	I don't really see you dripping in pussy, haha.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	105	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_783a4905	ry	Shut up!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	110	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_9d598f22	u	Frat or not, it all comes down to the looks. And one could not deny your boy's handsome as fuck, haha.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	113	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_25dd620f	ry	Now that you mention it, that first day I met you, I almost mistook you for a babe.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	118	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_1a6449c3	u	Ha!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	123	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_41e6520c	ry	No to be fair, who could ever mistake you for a girl with an ass pointy as that?! Haha.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	128	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_628da757	u	OK now that's too far, asshole!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	133	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_ffc80b55	ry	Anyway, I don't mind a day such as this sometimes. A cool breeze and a hot view, hehe.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	138	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_a6402742	u	I guess I should leave you at it, then. Let me check around for a bit.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	143	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_053e4bcb	ry	You do that, man.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	148	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_e8379126	u	Yo, how's my bro doing?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	153	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_a07c209d	ry	Just into some important scientific business.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	158	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_521df0c5	u	By staring at the girls, right?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	163	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_9379389a	ry	You make it sound like I'm monkeying around, but it's pretty important!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	168	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_46cafde1	u	Haha, how's that?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	173	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_f246a7dd	ry	There may be enough pussy to go around, but a man should properly evaluate first, you know?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	178	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_807cfaeb	u	And you are evaluating Riley and Aubrey?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	183	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_6ea9d3df	ry	It's just a way of sharpening up senses and expectations!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	188	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_30143dd3	u	So how's that working for you?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	193	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_55984293	ry	Good, good. For instance, I can tell you that Aubrey maybe looks like it, but I can sense she's not very experienced.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	198	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_49722f9e	u	Oh, haha dude, I think you got it all wrong.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	203	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_e7b991f8	ry	Or maybe I'm just not into giving away secrets!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	208	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_028e6a79	u	Yeah yeah, or that.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	213	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_464cdce0	ry	So what's up with you? You're looking more cheerful than usual today.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	218	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_6ba02e83	u	I'm not so sure about that. Last night I had a fucked up dream.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	227	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_29f18b00	ry	A dream, huh. What was it about?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	232	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_c9a180b5	u	There was this dark void all around me and then a boxing ring and then a fight.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	237	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_87d48738	ry	You were fighting someone? In a dark void?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	242	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_043c96ab	u	Yeah, I wanted to fight the Wolves. But no matter how hard I tried to hit, I did nothing.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	247	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_03f07a16	ry	Seems like you're worried about the Brawl, [name].	game/v9/scene7.rpy	252	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_0a1ae2ca	u	Not about the Brawl but, there was more.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	257	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_b88d72fb	ry	Yeah?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	262	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_23c8f3c4	u	No matter how hard I tried, everyone was disappointed in me.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	267	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_dc6e6030	u	It felt like fucking up everything.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	269	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_691adef7	u	Like losing there meant losing everything.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	270	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_feac0b19	ry	I get it. But it was all just a dream, right?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	275	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_30ce0142	u	I... I guess, so.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	280	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_28e74414	ry	Look, man. You got this, and I'm not just saying it.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	285	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_dce80447	u	Doesn't feel like that to me.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	290	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_ec5b3bf1	ry	I know, but that's how things always are from your own perspective.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	295	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_47c1dfd7	u	Sounds pretty wise, for words coming out of Ryan's mouth.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	300	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_c1654ba2	ry	I had moments like that too. You know, doubting yourself and all.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	305	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_4496ad5f	ry	But seeing you, [name]. You are the kind of guy who makes the right choices.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	310	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_86b36519	ry	And the kind of guy who can do this. Someone to show how great Apes are. And how hard they can punch.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	311	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_76a0d067	u	Thanks, Ryan. I didn't even know I needed this. But it seems I sure as fuck have.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	316	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_519b48a7	ry	No problem, that's what bros are for, am I right?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	321	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_ac92dc30	u	Right as fuck, my man.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	326	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_aa539ad9	u	I guess I am just excited.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	333	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_8d14f526	ry	About what?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	338	ry "[what]"
fr5ryan1_c99609d1	u	The Freshmen Brawl.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	343	u "[what]"

fr5ryan1_a6402742_1	u	I guess I should leave you at it, then. Let me check around for a bit.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	418	u "[what]"
fr5ryan1_053e4bcb_1	ry	You do that, man.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	423	ry "[what]"

fr5riley1_510a2cc3	ri	No, not in the mood for that. I just like being close, watching it, that's all.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	556	ri "[what]"

fr5aubrey1_d030d6c2	au	Oh what, don't tell me that [name] is afraid of a bit of cold water?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	614	au "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_bc78feac	u	What? Of course not!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	619	u "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_e15ef875	au	Boo-hoo, water is so cold, it would make his nipples sharp as a razor, boo-hoo.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	624	au "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_87c0faae	u	Freeze the lake if you want, I'm not afraid of the water no matter how cold it is.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	629	u "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_67ce54bf	au	Prove it! Come and join me.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	634	au "[what]"

fr5aubrey1_b03baac7	au	Yeah.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	644	au "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_db1a25f9	u	That was a nice try, miss. But you must be mistaking me for a child, if you thought that would work.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	653	u "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_6b1ea0c2	au	Boo! Boo!	game/v9/scene7.rpy	658	au "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_043c6ee5	u	Maybe some other time. I didn't bring my shorts, anyway.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	663	u "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_fda9681e	au	You are such a party-pooper, [name]. I'll forgive you, though. But don't forget, you owe me one now.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	668	au "[what]"

fr5aubrey1_97c8a142	u	If it's good to you, why would I be any different? So, why did you invite me here?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	718	u "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_f97453ac	au	I just thought it could be fun, you know. I was getting a bit lonely.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	723	au "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_c6b997fb	u	Well that can't be a good thing, especially if it's someone like you.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	728	u "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_f3559e2e	au	What do you mean "like me"? What am I like?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	733	au "[what]"

fr5aubrey1_191a6214	au	Oh, getting philosophical?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	743	au "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_5c6dc2eb	u	I just don't think a girl like you would want the world to stop. If anything, I'd say you'd want to spin it faster.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	748	u "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_51bc6fc0	au	Then I guess you know me a bit better than I would expect.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	753	au "[what]"
fr5aubrey1_04006b79	u	For one living in the moment, I wouldn't say you expect much at all. Well, maybe you don't expect much, but you surely know how to seize the moment.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	758	u "[what]"
v9_aubrey_scene_lake_27c4011f	au	Wow, you keep on surprising me, [name]. And you are right, I did think of something fun just now.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	767	au "[what]"

v9_aubrey_scene_lake_3bf52e69	au	We should probably swim back before the others notice we're missing though.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	902	au "[what]"
v9_aubrey_scene_lake_810fa79b	u	You sure you don't want me to do you?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	907	u "[what]"

v9s7_nsfwSkipLabel1_681cf30c	u	I'm not saying anything. But saying otherwise could be one lie over my weekly quota.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	987	u "[what]"
v9s7_nsfwSkipLabel1_0c950894	au	Funny. Or should I say clever.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	992	au "[what]"

fr5treeguy1_6de74ade	unknown	A few years back, this place was not so fine and dandy. To be honest, nobody wanted to live here.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	1072	unknown "[what]"
fr5treeguy1_f1c6d628	u	How so?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	1077	u "[what]"
fr5treeguy1_d2d67bb2	unknown	People wanna move to city, they don't see the beauty of the countryside no more.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	1082	unknown "[what]"

fr5treeguy1_632c65a7	u	Is that how you did it?	game/v9/scene7.rpy	1107	u "[what]"

fr5dogwalker1_b663e4a9	u	I see.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	1197	u "[what]"

fr5ryan3_37fe551f	u	Sure.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	1385	u "[what]"
fr5ryan3_155a8fde	ri	Let me grab our stuff.	game/v9/scene7.rpy	1390	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_781a0f73	ry	And that's how I won the scary challenge and was the only one who entered that house.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	13	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_21efdd1c	u	And you were like what, seven?	game/v9/scene8.rpy	18	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_9497fa07	ry	Eight, but that's not the point!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	23	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_d2467061	ri	What was the point of the story then?	game/v9/scene8.rpy	28	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_574b3d2a	ry	You just don't get it. The point is I was born with no fear. And I wasn't afraid ever since.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	33	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_c31b2f0d	au	Yeah right! That's just some stupid kids challenge. That proves nothing.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	39	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_a6822e5b	ry	Oh yeah? I don't think so. Bravery is recognized in people when they are still young.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	44	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_d6f50c92	ri	What has gotten into Ryan today, he's full brag mode on.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	49	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_f2073757	ry	Just stating the facts, but you don't have to believe me.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	54	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_5923d7b5	u	That story was kinda cool, though.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	59	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_b409d988	au	Really?!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	64	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_eaac88de	au	Don't tell me you really think Ryan's story was cool?	game/v9/scene8.rpy	66	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_cb51f3c5	ry	Heh heh, I told you so. Of course it is!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	71	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_9fc611ed	u	Reminds me of one thing I heard from someone a long time ago.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	76	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_a6435508	ry	My story?	game/v9/scene8.rpy	81	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_90f33614	u	Yeah. There was this guy, coming back home from the late night shift. He was driving a car, on a road similar to this one.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	86	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_c1564c4d	ri	You trying to scare us, now?	game/v9/scene8.rpy	91	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_93539e68	u	No, no, true story. He was really tired but he knew he was still safe to drive. When all out of nowhere...	game/v9/scene8.rpy	96	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_59e994f4	ry	What?!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	101	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_a0876971	u	He heard a loud noise from under the hood.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	110	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_4f16d06d	au	Ah, come on!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	115	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_04e169b6	u	He was really confused, so he looked below his wheel to see if something broke. But the moment he lifted his head back up Bang! He hit something with his car!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	120	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_77fcf6c8	ry	Come on, you're... you're making this up!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	125	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_70b05107	u	It was true! The guy didn't really feel the hit, but he was so sure hit something, that he immediately stomped the brakes.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	130	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_08045f44	au	Oh I would not stop for a second.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	135	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_7ab351bb	u	He took a moment and a deep breath, then exited his car.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	140	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_b13389bf	ri	No way, ridiculous!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	145	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_93cbdea0	u	He carefully looked in the distance and truly did see a shadow on the road, not moving. It was about 40... no, 30 yards away.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	150	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_2248b2fd	ry	Was a deer. A baby deer I'm sure of it!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	155	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_5fd138da	u	It wasn't a deer. Wasn't really easy to see even though the headlights were still on, so he made a couple of steps in the shadow's direction.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	160	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_fa966bf1	ry	I mean, who would be that stupid?!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	165	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_e69558ff	u	You mean brave? When he got so close that he almost could see what that thing was, the headlights suddenly went off!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	170	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_b5b4a67f	ri	Jesus!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	175	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_e611f019	au	Why?!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	180	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_17bbe6e1	u	So he immediately turns back to the car, but nothing was suspicious there. Yet, when he turned his head back to the shadow, the shadow was gone too!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	185	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_bbc12887	ry	No! You are making this up, stop!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	190	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_f0045484	u	Then he heard a noise, like the lock on his car clicked all out of sudden. So he looked back at the car again! And there, in the driver's seat, now was sitting a shadow.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	195	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_cb899e58	ri	Nooo, I don't want to listen to this either!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	200	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_3b711d89	au	Don't scare the driver, [name]!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	205	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_006506a7	u	So the guy ran and ran, but behind him the car had its headlights turning on and off, on and off... driving him insane.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	210	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_e34bf831	ry	Someone was messing with him, right?!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	215	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_7587e6d2	u	Right.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	220	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_aeea7ddb	ri	But who?	game/v9/scene8.rpy	225	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_b8417943	u	Luckily, another car was passing by and stopped to help the guy. Together, they went back to check on his car.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	230	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_a0961c2e	ry	Who was in the driver's seat??	game/v9/scene8.rpy	235	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_148ddd9f	u	No one. They've opened the car hood and that's when they found out...	game/v9/scene8.rpy	240	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_eaa4a6a7	ry	Racoon? Killer?? A ghost?!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	245	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_cad8bbd8	u	No. The car battery has gone haywire, sparking and all. It was causing all the problems.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	250	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_44822625	ri	Whaaaat?! You are joking, right!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	259	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_7c0d375d	ry	And the shadow?!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	264	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_e9bc6684	u	Well I did say he was pretty tired, haha. Eyes can deceive you when you're tired.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	269	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_8b5aa81b	au	Fuck, my heart almost stopped! That is so stupid!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	274	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_64964cf5	u	Hahaha, oh my God you guys, you are so easy to scare!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	279	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_bfd244de	ry	I... I knew it was something stupid all along!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	284	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_3de15674	u	Yeah right, hero. I think you were shaking the most.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	289	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_d3905d80	ry	Well one thing sure remains certain. You guys are fun to hang around with.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	294	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_04c20dbf	u	And you said it!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	299	u "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_455eac9f	ri	That seals the deal, then!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	304	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_7a667dd7	au	You are just a bunch of crazy people, haha.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	309	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_84d4036c	ry	Wait, wait, but I didn't tell you about my neighbor and the scary cat lady!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	314	ry "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_eb8e9e93	ri	Oh shut up, Ryan!	game/v9/scene8.rpy	319	ri "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_9bead381	au	Haha, there he goes again.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	324	au "[what]"
v9_driving_home_lake_2745c320	u	No, I just need to hear this now, haha.	game/v9/scene8.rpy	329	u "[what]"
